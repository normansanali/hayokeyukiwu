Fey struggled with her body image for a while, as she expressed in her bestselling book, Bossypants.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_51>“We should leave people alone about their weight. Being skinny for a while (provided you actually eat food and don’t take pills or smoke to get there) is a perfectly fine pastime. Everyone should try it once, like a super-short haircut or dating a white guy,” she said in her memoir.</p><p id=par-5_39>“Men I had met before suddenly paid attention to me… and I hated them for it . . . Sometimes I had to sleep with a pillow between my legs because my bony knees clanking together kept me awake.”</p><p id=par-6_50>The actress explored the other side of the weight loss and gain coin, saying as well in her book, “We should leave people alone about their weight. Being chubby for a while (provided you don’t give yourself diabetes) is a natural phase of life and nothing to be ashamed of.”</p><h2>Tina Fey is a Lifetime WW member</h2><p id=par-7_44>Fey opened up <a href=#>with Oprah Winfrey</a> in Jan. 2020 to talk about her career, her goals as a comedy writer, and of course, how she joined WW, formerly known as Weight Watchers in the 1990s, to learn to eat right and lose thirty pounds.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-8_63>“I joined [WW] in New York in—I had gone—I lived in Chicago and really enjoyed the food in Chicago. And the big coats.&nbsp;&nbsp;And then I moved to New York and we all took our coats off and I went, what happened? What happened? I was thinking, like, it’s time to sort of focus on [her weight gain] before it gets out of hand.”&nbsp;</p><h2>How she keeps looking and feeling great</h2><p id=par-9_35>The Date Night actress explained to Winfrey how she keeps herself on track without becoming too obsessed over the process. The now-50-year-old knows she has WW to turn to when she’s feeling out of control.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-10_37>“I know it’s there for me,” she told Winfrey. “I go in and out. Like I know it’s there when I need it. You know, like when I need to track, it will be there. . .”</p><p id=par-11_31>Fey told <a href=#>Self</a> in 2011 about the exercise routine that keeps her going. It’s not rigorous at all, and the best part is, it’s sustainable for anyone to keep up with.</p><p id=par-12_58>“I genuinely enjoy it. . . But I prefer my life a little more if I’m exercising regularly. . .I work out with a trainer—painfully infrequently. He uses the BOSU a lot. I like that. I like to be focused on not falling over, so I’m&nbsp;not&nbsp;focused on the fact that I’m squatting with a weight in my hands.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqrrAZp2esV2fwrTAjK2sq6aVmXp2fIyapZ1lo52us7HSZp%2Beql2osqS%2BxK1kn6eiYrimsc%2BipaBllp7Bb7TTpqNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
