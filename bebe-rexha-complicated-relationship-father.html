When she released the 2019 hit, "<a href=#>Last Hurrah,</a>" Bebe made a racy video for it, with people making out and dancing in little to no clothing. Funnily enough, the musician sings the lyric, "I don't need a lecture. No, thank you, honey, God bless ya." But, the musician was about to get a lecture whether she wanted to or not.</p><p>Following the release of the music video, Bebe shared a screenshot of her and her father, Flamur Rexha's, texts to her Instagram Stories with the caption, "My dad hates me," per <a href=#>E! News</a>. Flamur had something to say about the controversial "Last Hurrah" video. In one of the texts, he wrote, "You better stop posting stupid pornography because you make me sick I can't take this anymore embarrassed to go in public everywhere I can go i'm very upset with you I can't believe it." Ouch, that was a bit harsh, and many people thought so too.</p><p>Fans drove to social media to share their opinion on Bebe's dad, and they weren't that positive. One Twitter user<a href=#>&nbsp;wrote</a>, "That's not a real dad, I'm sorry. Dads are supposed to support no matter what. love you Bebe Rexha." This was just one of the many comments directed toward Flamur, and it had gotten so bad that Bebe had to explain her previous post.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtjbn50gY6bnJudXaeyubTAZpqopaChtqSt056bZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGKzosDHnqlo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
