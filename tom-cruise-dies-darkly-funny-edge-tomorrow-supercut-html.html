Every year there are great movies that slip through the cracks and fail to find a theatrical audience.

This year, Doug Liman’s sci-fi actioner <i><a href=#>Edge of Tomorrow</a></i> is one of those, and probably the most notable. Despite almost unanimous <a href=#>critical backing</a>, <a href=#>no one</a> went to see this movie in the theater when it opened in June. There are a number of theories, including a terrible, generic title that says nothing about the film (something they’ve been <a href=#>playing with</a> building up to the home video release), a mismanaged marketing campaign, and <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a> fatigue among audiences. If theatergoers are really sick of Cruise, this actually could be the movie they’d want to see the most, because he dies, a lot, often in spectacular fashion. If you don’t believe me, just watch this new supercut of the various ways he buys the proverbial farm, and this isn’t even all of them.</p><p><i>Edge of Tomorrow</i> follows the exploits of Bill Cage (Cruise), a marketing executive who joins the military after an alien invasion happens and lends his particular brand of expertise to the propaganda war. Through a series of events, and a vindictive senior officer, Cage, who has zero combat experience, winds up on the front lines. In the midst of a Normandy Beach-style assault, he dies moments into the battle. But low and behold, he wakes up at the beginning of the day, very much alive. <span id=more-106419></span></p><p>Caught in a time loop like this, he lives and dies countless times—like into the thousands—getting a little bit farther each time, eventually teaming up with Rita Vrataski (<a href=#>Emily Blunt</a>) to defeat the invaders. He trains and fights and attempts to unravel the alien’s strategy. But mostly he dies, accidentally, by his own hand, and sometimes with an assist from Rita. This video is basically just a Tom Cruise getting the living shit kicked out of him, and it’s just as hilarious as that sounds.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/emily-blunt-edge-of-tomorrow-1.jpg alt="edge of tomorrow" width=578 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>Though it sounds a bit like <i>Groundhog Day</i>, and certainly owes a debt to that film, <i>Edge of Tomorrow</i> is one of the most fun movies of the entire summer. We hope that this film, like <i>Dredd</i> a few years ago, finds a new audience once it hits <a href=#>home video</a> when it drops next week. If you haven’t seen it, it’s well worth your time. It’s surprisingly funny, this is Cruise working at a level that he hasn’t achieved in quite some time—he’s perfect at the smarmy Cage, but undergoes a legitimate, transformative character arc—and is one of the most entertaining, <a href=#>exciting</a>, clever movies not only of the summer, but of the entire year.</p><p>You can <a href=#>buy <i>Edge of Tomorrow</i> on October 7</a>.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1408042502.jpg alt="Edge of Tomorrow" width=578 height=785 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irk56zqnvTqKRmm6KqtrSxjJ2gnqtdma6zt8uyZJ%2BtnqPGbrHDoJxmrJ%2BivLO%2BzrBkrK2gmr%2BkwdNnn62lnA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
