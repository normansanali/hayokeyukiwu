The first one ran from the end of November until December 2nd. The game then witnessed another such weekend with the arrival of Season 1 Reloaded on December 14th. This 2 XP event ran from December 15 through December 19.</p><p>Now that another mid-season update has been released, for Season 2, everyone is seemingly wondering about this year’s first double XP event. Fortunately, there’s good news for players who are waiting for it. Media outlet CharlieIntel recently revealed that the <strong>next double XP event will run from March 17 through March 20 for all the platforms. PlayStation users have got an advantage here as they have already received the option of 2 XP from March 16 to March 17</strong>.</p><p>The Double XP weekend is expected to start at 10 AM PT, 12 PM CT, 1 PM ET, and 6 PM GMT.
