The lovebirds shared some laughs and smiles as they engaged in conversation during the outing.

She wore an orange string bikini that time while he wore a loose short-sleeved blue button-down shirt with daisies printed all over it and black Nike shorts. They both added sunglasses to their looks and when Millie noticed a camera, she flashed a smile, clearly taking in the joys of the moment.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Millie and Jake’s getaway seems to prove their relationship is going strong. They started dating in the summer of 2021 and haven’t been shy about sharing <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their romance</a> with the world. The Stranger Things star brought him along to the show’s fourth season premiere and they looked gorgeous while posing on the red carpet of the event.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Millie also shared her feelings for the hunk when she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>posted a photo</a> of them sharing a sweet kiss at a <strong>Harry Styles</strong> concert in London.
