Explore His Relationship</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-07-04</div><p><strong>James Bouknight’s Wife</strong>: James Bouknight, an American professional basketball player, is still single since he is too young to marry. Also, the rising star is no longer dating anybody, choosing to live a single life and concentrate only on his basketball career.&nbsp;Aside from that, James has been a controversial athlete throughout his brief professional career. He has been arrested several times and has always been in the public eye for these issues.<br>However, the basketball star remains tight-lipped when it comes to discussing his relationship and love life. James David Bouknight, a professional basketball player born on September 18, 2000, rose to prominence while playing for the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association.</p><p>Similarly, the basketball star honed his skills while playing for the UConn Huskies in college. The Hornets selected him with the eleventh choice in the 2021 NBA draft, and he officially joined the team on August 3, 2021.&nbsp;The 6 feet 4 inches tall basketball player made his NBA debut on October 22, 2021, and scored his first points on November 26 of the same year he was selected. James’ greatest game was on December 10, when he scored a career-high 24 points.&nbsp;Before the 2022-23 season, the contentious basketball figure switched his uniform number from 5 to 2. Unfortunately, his tenure with the Hornets ended abruptly as he was dismissed on February 8, 2024.</p><h2>James Bouknight Wife</h2><p><strong>James Bouknight</strong> is currently single. He hasn’t mentioned his relationship or presented anybody who looks like his spouse. Also, the rising basketball player has not been seen with anybody who looks to be his girlfriend. Until the publishing of this piece, there was no mention of his wedding preparations or engagement.&nbsp;For the time being, the athlete seems to be entirely focused on his burgeoning profession and has no desire to get involved in any romance.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/James-Bouknight-1.jpg alt="James Bouknight" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The basketball player’s whole attention and commitment seem to be limited to his profession at the moment since he is still in its early stages. Many problems have already jeopardized his job, therefore he may not have time to consider dating anybody.&nbsp;He could discover the right match for himself in the coming days.&nbsp;Furthermore, no material supports his previous relationship or dating history.&nbsp;He may or may not have dated someone in the past.&nbsp;In addition, James has strong bonds with his family, friends, and teammates. He has not been in a relationship dispute until now.</p><h2>Personal Life and Controversies</h2><p>James, an NBA player, has already encountered several issues and legal challenges in his early career.&nbsp;Yes, he has been arrested multiple times for reckless driving. On October 16, 2022, at around 1:51 a.m., Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police detained the American basketball player for driving while drunk. Around 12:44 a.m., he was discovered unconscious in a parking garage. When caught, the young sportsman was carrying a 40-caliber pistol, a bag of Doritos, and a Glock 23.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/James-Bouknight-2.jpg alt="James Bouknight" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Later, his bond was set at $2,500, and the athlete was back exercising the following day.&nbsp;James had previously been arrested for speeding and dangerous driving, so this wasn’t the first time he had run into legal issues while driving.&nbsp;For all of these reasons, his legal issues and disputes take precedence over his romantic life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihmqWVqHqju9SkpaKfmKl6uLXFnmSwoJ9itrR5x55kppmip7amsIytpmadqKW5sL7EZp%2Biq12nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
