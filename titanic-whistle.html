An invaluable collection of items belonging to a heroic officer who survived that terrible shipwreck is now headed to auction.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Fox News</a>, these items belonged to fifth officer Harold Lowe. Revered as one of the heroes of the tragic incident, Lowe not only potentially served as the literal whistleblower of the maritime disaster — but commanded the 14th lifeboat and rescued survivors from the icy waters.</p><p>After delivering the passengers on his lifeboat to safety, Lowe was the only officer to go back to the wreck to pull more survivors out of the water. In James Cameron’s movie version, he’s depicted as rescuing Kate Winslet’s Rose during this brave return.</p><p>Lowe, who was born in North Wales and respectfully portrayed by Welsh actor Ioan Gruffudd, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was 29 at the time of his Atlantic heroics</a> and remained a sailor after the incident. He died in 1944 at 61 years of age. This is the first time any of these items from his archive have been up for auction.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-283787 alt="Photograph Of Harold G Lowe" width=900 height=599 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photograph-of-harold-g-lowe.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-283787 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Henry Aldridge & Son</span><span class=caption-body>Lowe remained a sailor after the disaster, and died at 61 in 1944.</span></p><p>“Harold Lowe was without doubt one of the heroes of the Titanic disaster,” said auctioneer Andrew Aldridge of the British auction house in question, Henry Aldridge & Son. “As he loaded women and children in the lifeboats it is said he ordered J.Bruce Ismay, the managing director White Star Line, to get out of his way, telling him ‘you will have me drown the lot of them’, if he didn’t.”</p><p>No other officers dared turn back toward the wreck, as they feared desperate and freezing survivors would overwhelm the boats. Lowe’s unique bravery has been celebrated ever since, imbuing even his whistle with deep significance.</p><p>Though Aldridge is careful to note, “It is unknown if this was the whistle Officer Lowe had on Titanic, however it is without doubt his Officer’s whistle.”</p><p>The whistle, engraved “Lieutenant H.G. Lowe RNR” (Royal Naval Reserve), is listed with a pre-sale estimate of $2,526 to $3,788. The auction’s vast roster of items also includes a signed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photo of the Titanic</a>‘s officers aboard the rescue ship Carpathia, a telescope, and more.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-283790 alt="Telescope Of Harold G Lowe" width=900 height=578 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/telescope-of-harold-g-lowe.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-283790 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Henry Aldridge & Son</span><span class=caption-body>The engraved telescope gifted to Lowe was inscribed with “To Harold G.

For a collection of a handful of items more than 108 years old, that’s rather remarkable.</p><p>After learning about the whistle of Titanic officer Harold G.
