On Wednesday, July 24, the singer-songwriter posted a shirtless photo outdoors sporting a silver double-studded eyebrow piercing and diamond grill. The up-close-and-personal shot showed off the new accessories loud and clear, as opposed to the last selfie that Bieber posted on Tuesday, July 23.

The grill has a casual three rows of diamonds and rumor has it that it costs $50,000. Gold Teeth God posted a video of the specific grill he sold to Bieber and it’s seriously blinding.</p><p>Bieber’s followers have mixed feelings about his new look. “Are we in 2008 or what?????” wrote one disappointed user. Some expressed concern, like one follower who warned him, “You are spending money foolishly on yourself you don’t need that in your mouth!”</p><p>But some folks are feeling his new bling. Another Instagrammer fully supports the look and feels inspired, commenting, “Time for me to put my eyebrow jewelry back in again.” And yet another fan summed up her reaction with “🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hailey reportedly got in on the fun too while at the salon, but took a tamer approach to by getting <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two new helix piercings</a>.</p><p>Let’s not forget that this isn’t Bieber’s first time testing out facial piercings.
