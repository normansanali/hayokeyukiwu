Different things work for different people. Every life is different. No two people have the exact same experience. So go to the people you love and trust most … and really tune out the rest. You might need to turn off social media!”</p><p>Cameron Bure and the athlete went on to welcome sons Lev and Maksim in 2000 and 2002, respectively, and the<a href=#> Dancing With the Stars </a>alum took an acting hiatus to raise her brood.</p><p>“<a href=#>It was so hard</a>. I felt worthless,” the Kind Is the New Classy author said during a “Motherly” podcast episode in November 2020. “I felt like I had been gifted all of these things in life, whatever that is, whatever skills God gave me. And I thought, ‘I’m not using them’. … And it was like, [fans] were always disappointed, which in turn made me feel even more like, ‘Oh, my gosh, being a mom … I’m ‘just’ a mom. Like, this is not valued by society.”</p><p>The former <a href=#>View</a> cohost’s faith subsequently “kicked in,” she went on to say.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I started reading my Bible and going, ‘I need validation. I mean, that’s the honest truth. I need validation. I don’t feel like I’m getting it,’” the Dancing Through Life author explained at the time. “Although I got it from my husband. But I didn’t feel like I was getting it from every other place in life that I’d always gotten validation from. I am valued by God, whether I’m a stay-at-home mom, whether I have a successful career or whether I do absolutely nothing all day long, he loves me no matter what, I don’t have to prove anything to him.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see the former Hallmark star’s best moments with Natasha, Lev and Maksim over the years, from <a href=#>Mother’s Day</a> celebrations to on-set selfies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNksKK6w5qanmWTlrqmvs6nZK%2BZnJq%2FqnnBrqmeq12ltbDAzqxksKGknXp0ecqim6xllpa6qrjYZpilmqWifA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
