Not to mention, it can also cost a pretty coin to create your dream home. And when it comes to Fixer Upper: Welcome Home, there are a few guidelines hopefuls must agree to.</p><p>"Fixer Upper, Welcome Home hopefuls [must] either already be homeowners, or in the final stages of closing on a home and the property must be within 30 miles of Waco."</p><p>It's also important to note that homeowners should be "21 years of age or older and have a $50k minimum renovation budget."&nbsp;</p><p>And while this may be hard for some, in order to appear on Fixer Upper: Welcome Home, you'd have to relinquish control of design concepts. The final guideline states that "hopefuls must be willing to turn over complete design control of the project to Chip and Joanna Gaines, their design and construction teams, and Magnolia Network."</p><p>Keep in mind, just because the new series Fixer Upper: Welcome Home is already in full swing, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't apply.
