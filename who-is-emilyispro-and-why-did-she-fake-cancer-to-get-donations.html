Check out this instance, in 2015, Lily James (the actress who played Cinderella in the Disney film Cinderella ), in an effort to express her excitement at the film’s successful premiere in Tokyo wrote via Instagram: “Shinderera” was premiered in Tokyo…” This rather simple post went viral and generated a lot of hateful posts, with many accusing her of racism for mocking the Japanese pronunciation of Cinderella."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

singular tweet that she considered funny, became one of the most hated individuals on the planet.&nbsp;Just before heading to South Africa in 2013, she tweeted: “Going to Africa.&nbsp;I hope I don’t have AIDS.&nbsp;I laugh.&nbsp;I am white!&nbsp;And the whole internet came for her.&nbsp;If it were possible, she would have been torn to pieces.</span></p><p><span>It is true that there is freedom of expression on social media.&nbsp;However, networking platforms are nowhere to get away with pretty much.</span></p><p><span>Well, these two cases cannot be said to be exactly the case with Emilyispro, because many might say that Lily and Sacco’s cases were simply a mistake, while Emilyispro’s is a premeditated action that was intended to deceive and extort money to an innocent audience, well, wait maybe you’ve read the whole story behind his action before deciding where to put it.</span></p><p><strong><span>See Also: Cherry Crush Biography, Age, Height, Facts and Family Life of YouTube Star</span></strong></p><h2><strong><span>Who is Emilyispro and why did she fake cancer to get donations?</span></strong></h2><p><span>We won’t provide you with her biography, nor provide general information about the streamer, as there is little information about her online.&nbsp;Emilyispro is the online handle of Twitch streamer Emily Schröder.</span></p><p><span>Emily is a Runescape streamer who has recently been the subject of much controversy.&nbsp;She had broken down during one of her streams, claiming to have&nbsp;</span><span>chronic lymphocytic&nbsp;</span><span>leukemia,</span><span>&nbsp;it went viral and garnered sympathy from the public who did their best to donate towards her treatment.&nbsp;She reportedly made over $100,000 from her viewers.</span></p><p><span>The controversy and her being called a cancer prostitute began after she, in another stream, denied ever saying she had the fictional disease.&nbsp;People began to speculate that Emily Schröder must have faked the cancer story to garner sympathy and donations – this led to the copypasta line “Emily faked cancer”, which went viral on social media.</span></p><p><span>The original video of the stream cannot be found online, but footage of Schröder chronicling the 2013 incident is available.&nbsp;</span><span>Youtube.</span></p><p><span>YouTuber Vexxed came to Emilyispro’s defense when he uploaded a video to his channel discussing the controversy.&nbsp;In the video, Vexxed said the charges against her are not justifiable, as there is “no evidence” that she claimed to have been diagnosed with cancer and that it was all “just a memory”.&nbsp;Vexxed then sent another video showing Emily denying she faked cancer.</span></p><p><span>Many have asked the Runescape community to ban it but it hasn’t been banned and it has made people even more panicked considering other people are getting Runescape banned for less trivial offenses than the one it has committed.&nbsp;A wheelchair gamer has already been banned from Twitch.tv after being accused of faking his disability.</span></p><p><span>The player who goes by the name Angel “zilianOP” Hamilton appeared regularly on Twitch.tv and was known to be paralyzed from the waist down.&nbsp;He therefore used this service to earn money through donations.&nbsp;On the day his act of deception was exposed, Hamilton is seen standing and walking as he was filmed.&nbsp;Although he didn’t appear to be standing up straight, he was walking unaided.</span></p><p><span>After Hamilton’s impact, a Twitch spokesperson came out to condemn his action saying it was a huge slap in the face to members of the Twitch community with real disabilities, and that Twitch has zero tolerance for this type of bullying. behavior.&nbsp;He added that the community will offer refunds to those who subscribe to his channel through their platform.&nbsp;It left questions over why Emilyispro didn’t receive the same punishment as Hamilton.</span></p><p class=postsid
