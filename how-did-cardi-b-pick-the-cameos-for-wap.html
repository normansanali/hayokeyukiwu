From defending her choice to cast Kylie Jenner to how the other ladies got the invite — keep on scrolling to find out!</p><h2 id=kylie-jenner-39-s-cameo-was-very-controversial><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kylie Jenner's Cameo Was Very Controversial</span></h2><p>The most controversial celebrity appearance in the "WAP" music video is surely the one by reality television star Kylie Jenner. While plenty of fans wondered why Cardi B picked Jenner, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the rapper revealed to Apple Music</a>: "I wanted a lot of different females, not just female rappers. Y'all going to see it on the music video as well, from models to influencers and everything."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Fans weren't a fan of Kylie Jenner appearing in the music video</a>, but Cardi B defended her decision on social media <a href=#>by tweeting</a>: "Not everything is about race... Why did I put Kylie in my music video? She treated my sister and daughter so lovely at her kid bday party."</p><h2 id=normani-was-thrilled-to-join-the-cast><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Normani Was Thrilled To Join The Cast</span></h2><p>Musician Normani is another big name that appears in the "WAP" music video. The singer admitted that when she was asked to join the cast she couldn't say no. "The 'WAP' video I was really, really excited to be a part of, just because I feel like we’re in a time in music where women — and Black women — are really on top, which is something I feel like we haven't seen in a very, very long time," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Here's What Megan Thee Stallion Has Been Up To Since 'WAP' Came Out">Here's What Megan Thee Stallion Has Been Up To Since 'WAP' Came Out</a></span></p><p>"Where I come from, we were all about female empowerment. The fact that I could be a part of such a special moment embracing our sexuality, in which I definitely think there’s a double standard, [was exciting] to be a part of it."</p><h2 id=rosal-iacute-a-represented-her-home-country><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Rosalía Represented Her Home Country</span></h2><p>Spanish singer Rosalía also makes an appearance in the music video. Cardi B not only had Rosalía make a cameo, but she also allowed her to represent where she comes from. In "WAP", Rosalía is paying "homage to the brave matadors who risk their lives in the ring," as her home country Spain is the bullfighting capital of the world. Cardi B even revealed on Instagram: "Fun fact: Rosalía’s hairstyle is representing bullfighter wardrobe. It represents her country’s culture. I think that’s dope !!!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rubi-rose-got-contacted-by-offset><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Rubi Rose Got Contacted By Offset</span></h2><p>While Kylie Jenner, Normani, and Rosalía were already well-known names in the industry when "WAP' came out, many didn't know some of the other women who made cameos. One of them is rapper Rubi Rose, who revealed that it was actually Cardi B's husband Offset who originally reached out for the collaboration. "Offset DM’d me on Instagram to do a video, but didn’t say what it was for," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rubi Rose said</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Snoop Dogg Disses On Cardi B's 'WAP' In An Interview With Central Ave">Snoop Dogg Disses On Cardi B's 'WAP' In An Interview With Central Ave</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was like, 'I'll do the video if I can get a feature off you,' and then he never responded. But then a PR lady hit me up and it went from there. When we actually got to set, there was a big-ass greenscreen and a guy on a mic just hyping me up. We decided to dance and shake ass and be crazy. After that video, I gained, like, 200,000 followers on Instagram. My streams went up. I was planning to go to law school, but with all this shit going on right now, hopefully [it'll be] one day in the future. Maybe I can put my degree to use and be in politics or some crazy shit."</p><h2 id=mulatto-thought-she-was-getting-pranked><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Mulatto Thought She Was Getting Pranked</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rapper Mulatto admitted that starring in a music video for Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion was a dream come true. "When I got that call, I swore my manager was pranking me,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the rapper said</a>. “My mind could not register the fact that Cardi B even knew who I was, let alone wanted me to be in her video. I will always love her for that, because she knew what putting us in that video would do for our careers. It’s a beautiful time right now for female rap. We’re creating a whole new agenda. We’re supporting each other and collabing. The industry, fan bases, and blogs want us to beef, but we’re making it a friendly sport.”</p><h2 id=sukihana-was-surprised-cardi-b-knew-about-her><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sukihana Was Surprised Cardi B Knew About Her</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Similar to the other ladies on the list, rapper Sukihana was also surprised when she got the call to be in the "WAP" music video. "I was in the hair salon when they called me," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sukihana said</a>. "It was like, ‘Hey, you want to be in Cardi’s video? Cardi says she loves you, girl. I was like, ‘Are you f--king kidding me?’ Me and my girls were all screaming. She didn’t have to share her platform with me. I really appreciate her for that."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="Addison Rae Redefines WAP And It's Nothing Like Cardi B's Version">Addison Rae Redefines WAP And It's Nothing Like Cardi B's Version</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecKaqZ2hXZd6sbXCpGStoJVisKK5xKiqZp6fp3q4rc9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
