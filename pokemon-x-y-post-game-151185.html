DP were literally only missing the past starters, Legendaries, and the Tangela and Tropius lines. Everything else could be caught in-game. Between the PokeRadar, post-game areas, and inserting GBA cartridges into the DS, there was a huge variety in both the number of Pokemon you could capture and the ways you could encounter them. It made for a wholly lengthy and enjoyable post-game, in trying to catch them all, and it's way more enjoyable than tirelessly transferring 500+ species to fill up the Dex.</p><p>*Significant amount of post-game areas to explore. Black and White were a step in the right direction, but I wouldn't mind exploring a chain of islands or something completely off the coast of Kalos. Maybe some post-game Gyms or something of that nature, but throw in some story elements too. Eastern Unova was interesting, but the lack of direction or story made it a little boring and short-lived. And once you finished exploring it, it was just kind of "done." It was nice but ultimately unsatisfying.</p><p>*This doesn't completely fall under post-game only stuff, but we definitely need Secret Bases, be it through the Underground, overworld, or some new way. None of this Dream World crap. Let me build my own base, personalize it to my liking, and link up with other friends to battle them after finding their own bases. I even miss digging up fossils and just messing around in the Underground. They really need to bring this back in some form in X and Y.</p><p><b>On BW's post-game</b>: it didn't compare with Diamond and Pearl's. In terms of story and post-game only areas, yes, BW had more. But DP introduced, on top of everything else, online play. That had a tremendous impact on the longevity of the game, being able to battle and trade wirelessly across the world for the first time. And you still had the Underground, PokeRadar, Battle Zone, Contests, Pal Park, Battle Tower (which wasn't nearly as stale as it is now), and a slew of new Legendaries and Pokemon to catch. Not to mention the Sinnoh quest itself was longer, more challenging, and there was much more to explore (in terms of routes, cities and landmarks). While BW obviously have online play, and in an expanded state, for returning players it isn't the new innovative and exciting feature it was back then. Naturally we'll taking advantage of these features less as time goes on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyxu8qepKimXa16unnPqKqtZZeWuqZ6kG5oanBlZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
