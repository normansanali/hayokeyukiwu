The cutest idea! I took photos of them, studied the ingredients, and decided I was going to make a copycat recipe of Williams Sonoma Peppermint Bark Cups. They are crazy expensive and I knew that I could make them at home for a fraction of the price.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC_0820-copy.jpg alt="Peppermint Bark Cookie Dough Cups by Modern Honey.

It was such a fun challenge to create new and innovative recipes! So I decided with these Peppermint Bark Cups, I needed to be a little more creative.</p><p>How many of you LOVE cookie dough? My husband begs for me to save him two cookies worth of cookie dough every single time so he can eat it plain. It’s his favorite part! Have you seen the shirt Eat Raw Food…By Raw I Mean Cookie Dough? Seriously genius shirt.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC_0839-copy.jpg alt="Peppermint Bark Cookie Dough Cups by Modern Honey.

A dessert straight from heaven! I experimented with this recipe and was thrilled that it turned out beautifully and the Peppermint Bark Cookie Dough Cups were born.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC_0711-copy.jpg alt="Peppermint Bark Cookie Dough Cups by Modern Honey.

They are as easy as can be! You start with a cookie dough made with fresh butter, brown sugar, sugar, vanilla, and milk instead of eggs. Eggs are a binder and since we don’t have to worry about baking this cookie dough, we don’t need them! The milk makes it creamy and rich. Then you add in your flour and chocolate chips and your cookie dough is done. These Peppermint Bark Cookie Dough Cups are an easy, no-bake dessert which can be whipped up in no time at all.</p><p>These Peppermint Bark Cookie Dough Cups can be made in medium size cupcake liners or mini size cupcake liners. I use the mini size to make bite size cookie cups. The mini size liners can be found at any store in the baking aisle. I even found my festive ones at the Dollar store.</p><p>If you use the mini cups, it’s easiest to have a mini muffin pan. This is the one that I own and it’s only 8 bucks on Amazon — <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B000SABX12 data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow>Wilton Recipe Right 24 Cup Mini Muffin Pan</a></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC_0724-copy.jpg alt="Peppermint Bark Cookie Dough Cups by Modern Honey.

Here’s a simple method. Take a saucepan and fill it with a little bit of water (about 1/2 – 1 cup). Bring it to a boil and then reduce it to low and let it simmer. Place a large heatproof bowl, such as a glass Pyrex bowl, on top of the pot so that it is sitting on top of it. <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B00LGLHUA0 data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow>Pyrex 3-Piece Glass Mixing Bowl Set</a>&nbsp; Add chocolate chips to bowl and let the hot steam gently melt it so that’s it is silky smooth. Watch the chocolate and stir often.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC_0704.jpg alt="Peppermint Bark Cookie Dough Cups by Modern Honey.

A little tip: you can crush them on your own by placing candy canes in a bag and breaking them up with a rolling pin or you can buy crushed candy canes at stores such as World Market.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC_0768-copy.jpg alt="Peppermint Bark Cookie Dough Cups by Modern Honey.
