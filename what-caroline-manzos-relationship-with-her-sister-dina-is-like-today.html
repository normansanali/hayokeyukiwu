To add to their complicated family dynamic, Caroline is married to Thomas' brother, Albert Manzo. "We are heartbroken. This is family on both sides, " Caroline told <a href=#>Extra TV</a>. "I want to know the truth and my allegiance will lie with the truth," she said, adding, "We don't run from things like this, we address them, and I feel comfortable with that because we are being painted with a brush that does not reflect who we are as people."</p><p data-children-count=0>While Dina and Caroline's relationship may be up and down, Dina said she's still close with the rest of her family. "I get infuriated when people say, 'You don't speak to your family.' I have 10 siblings," she told Lewis in 2018. "We don't see each other often because we're on different coasts. But we're definitely fine."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGhiZ394e9ahmK1lk5a%2FsLjIp5xmpZGjx7C%2FjKucpZmknryvv8eip2avmam1brTEq2SsoaOpsrN5w6KlmmWZqHqttcqeZK2nlJbGcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
