He had entrusted very few people about his health status but revealed that a few close ones used the knowledge to extort the actor for up to $10 million over the years in order to keep quiet. "What people forget is that's money they're taking from my children ... I trusted them and they were deep in my inner circle, and I thought they could be helpful. My trust turned to their treason," Sheen shared. The "Young Guns" star admitted that a prostitute that he had slept with took a picture of his anti-retroviral medication and threatened to sell it to the tabloids. By coming out with the news, Sheen told Matt Lauer, "I release myself from this prison today."</p><p dir=ltr>Despite Sheen declaring that he had disclosed that he had HIV with his partners, <a href=#>Radar</a> reported that multiple women had come forward claiming that they weren't informed by the actor. One unnamed ex-girlfriend sued the actor, accusing him of exposing her to HIV, per <a href=#>TMZ</a>. Sheen settled out of court and agreed to pay her $120,000 in $10,000 monthly installments over the course of a year. While the settlement and extortions caused a dip in his bank account, Sheen's further antics cause him to lose out on acting jobs, causing his net worth to drop significantly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtkaIB6gY6hprBlk52us7jInmSsoJWau264zqyrZqufYrq2r8dmpKimla58</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
