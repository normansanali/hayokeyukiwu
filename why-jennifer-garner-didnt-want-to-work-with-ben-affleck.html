They had one of the longest-enduring celebrity love stories before they eventually called it quits after 10 years of marriage.

Affleck expressed his desire to direct a Jennifer Garner film, but Garner once made it clear that she had no intention of working with Affleck again. So, what could be the reasons behind her decision and the factors that contributed to her reluctance?</p><h2 id=ben-affleck-wanted-to-direct-jennifer-garner-in-a-film>Ben Affleck Wanted To Direct Jennifer Garner In A Film</h2><p>After originally breaking up with Jennifer Lopez in the early 2000s, Ben Affleck found his soul mate in Pearl Harbor co-star Jennifer Garner, with whom he would be married before ultimately separating ways.</p><p>Despite their ups and downs in life, he asserted that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Garner had assisted him in regaining his foothold in the industry</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar41687876.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking to an interview, he confided, “Getting to know Jennifer, falling in love with her and being connected with her gave me a foundation to reach out and say, okay, I’m going to do Hollywoodland. I’m going to direct Gone Baby Gone. Those were the steps forward I needed to put positive stuff on the board.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Divorce From Jennifer Garner Is Ben Affleck’s “Biggest Regret”</a></span></p><p>Affleck acknowledged the role of Garner in the resurgence of his career by giving him the inspiration he needed to do certain tasks. Even after the two put an end on their marriage, they remained amicable and friendly with each other. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Affleck would even love to direct a film with his ex-wife in it</a>.</p><p>“I think that would be great. I’ve often said that I want to direct a movie that Jennifer was in because I think she’s so great and she could do something really cool,” Affleck said in a 2017 interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apparently, it never yet happened because of the scheduling problem. “The problem that gets in the way is that one of us has to be looking after the kids at home,” he added.</p><h2 id=jennifer-garner-doesn-rsquo-t-want-to-work-with-ben-affleck>Jennifer Garner Doesn’t Want To Work With Ben Affleck</h2><p>The dynamics between actors and directors in the film industry can greatly impact the creative process and overall success of a project. In the case of Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck, their professional collaboration faced a roadblock due to Garner's reluctance to work with Affleck.</p><p>Although Affleck expressed his desire to collaborate with Garner again, the actress once brushed off the idea of working with him due to creative differences. She said in an interview, “I don’t want to because he is not the world’s fastest director, and I like to get in and do my work and go home and put the kids to bed.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jennifer Garner Had A Wise Strategy With The Children After They Would Read Gossip About Her Relationship With Ben Affleck</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Garner admired Affleck’s directing career, she felt that she would have been bothered by pacing as a film director.</p><p>She added, “I’m afraid there would be this moment where I would say, ‘OK. You’ve got it. I promise you it is in the can. I’ve got to go home.’ But you know, life is long and I never say never. I think Ben is brilliant at what he does. I am so happy for and proud of him.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Another reason behind their decision</a> not to collaborate again might be the previous projects they worked on, which weren’t well received by the public. The last films they worked on together didn’t do too well financially and critically. In the film industry, an actor's reputation and the success of their previous collaborations can significantly impact future career choices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Garner, an accomplished actress in her own right, likely wants to distance herself from projects that were met with disappointment. By avoiding further collaborations with Affleck, she can focus on pursuing roles that showcase her talent and resonate positively with both fans and critics.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Does Jennifer Garner Feel About Ben Affleck Now?</a></span></p><p>Speaking about the issue, Affleck explained, “I think audiences have a hard time suspending disbelief. They already know a whole bunch of things about the relationship you have with the other person and if you try and thrust you and another person into a fictional relationship, I think it is distracting.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/depositphotos_314902102_xl.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, as actors, both Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have the autonomy to make decisions that align with their career goals and aspirations.</p><p>Garner's choice to avoid working with Affleck again, possibly influenced by the mixed reception of their previous projects, reflects her commitment to selecting projects that will enhance her artistic reputation and resonate positively <a href=#>with audiences and critics alike</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdn7KvusifnKtll5a%2Fr7HRZpuinJ6peritza1kraddrLyzt4ywoK2gXZeyr3nAn52lnZOgfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
