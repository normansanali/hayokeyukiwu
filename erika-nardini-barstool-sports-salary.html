Despite that, most people have no idea who Erika Nardini is. With that in mind, it begs two obvious questions. What does Nardini do for Barstool Sports and how much money does she make.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-erika-nardini-do-for-barstool-sports>What Does Erika Nardini Do For Barstool Sports?</h2><p>When people look at what Erika Nardini has done for Barstool Sports, it is difficult to overstate how impressive her time as the company’s CEO has been. According to reports, under Erika Nardini’s stewardship, Barstool Sports went from a company with 12 employees to one where more than 600 people work. On top of that, when Nardini began working for Barstool Sports, it was a small company. According to celebritynetworth.com, Barstool Sports became so successful under Nardini’s control that Penn National Gaming paid $450 million for 36% of the company.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Most Famous Female CEOs In The World</a></span></p><p>As Barstool Sports CEO, there are some parts of Erika Nardini’s job that are obvious to everyone.

Everybody in your company has a problem at any given minute about multiple things, and having the stamina to work through that I think is important. I also think there’s a lot of … I like to be really involved. I think there’s CEOs who want to be distanced from their company, or they only talk to their management team, or stuff like that. I don’t really like that; I want to be really close to the people doing the most interesting things here.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on what Erika Nardini said in the aforementioned interview, it seems clear her job principally consists of two things.
