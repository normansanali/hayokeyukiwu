The talks were first reported by Bloomberg.</p><p>Nevertheless, insiders emphasize that no banker has been hired and no sales book is circulating. As for Nexstar, the TV conglomerate isn’t in a good position to pay what Disney would likely be asking for ABC, according to sources close to the situation.</p><p>“Everyone is way ahead of their skis on this story,” a banker briefed on the talks said. “They don’t know what is happening here.”</p><p>“Disney taking a meeting doesn’t mean you’re ready to sell, it means you’re getting offers,” the banker added. “This is something evolving over many weeks.”</p><p><a href=#>Iger put ABC into play in June when he told CNBC </a>that legacy television assets including ABC might not be considered core for Disney in the future. Nevertheless, some skeptics saw it as Iger inviting a deep-pocketed bidder to come forward. Thus far, none have materialized.</p><p>“He told the world if someone wants to put a really big number on these assets he will sell,” a second banker said. “I just don’t see a buyer.”</p><p>According to securities filings, Disney trades at 16 times its adjusted Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That’s a stiff premium to Nexstar’s multiple — a little better than five times — and implies a price tag for ABC that would terrify Nexstar’s shareholders, according to sources.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/NYPICHPDPICT000006623032-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/NYPICHPDPICT000039576832-1.jpg><p>Disney doesn’t disclose ABC’s profitability. While some chatter has put it north of $1 billion, one source close to the company said it’s likely well south of that figure as TV viewership continues to plummet.</p><p>That implies a realistic price tag between $7 billion and $8 billion at the most — and that is likely optimistic, according to some insiders.</p><p>A large private equity firm in recent days has called Disney to express its interest in a deal, a source who consults with PE firms and has direct knowledge of the situation said. Disney told the firm it is evaluating its ABC options and has not started a sales process.</p><p>Sources said that if Iger doesn’t succeed in selling ABC, he could <a href=#>offer it as part of a package with other properties</a>, such as FX and Nat Geo, for instance.</p><p>Indeed, outside of Nexstar, the other likely bidders for ABC are seen as private-equity firms, whose lack of operational synergies for ABC would prevent them from paying more than 6 or 7 times Ebitda, two bankers who have crunched the numbers said.</p><p>In the current environment, a private equity firm can’t easily borrow more than 4 to 5 times Ebitda against ABC and would likely be paying an 11 percent interest rate on those loans, one of the bankers said.</p><p>Whatever the exact number, it’s not likely to be much better than half of where Disney’s overall valuation lies — and that would make it hard for Iger to get excited about such a deal, the banker said.</p><p>“I don’t think he would and that is why all this is a silly conversation,” the banker said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma2lfnru0tcOeqaxlkaeybr%2FKnqetoZOWuW6twaisrWWUnsCvsdhmmp6nXZe8o3nIoJyrq12YtaK6wp6qZqyfYsCmuMtmmJubXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
