After graduation I went away to college in a beach town where there was nowhere to perform and realized I needed to do stand-up. So I transferred back home near San Diego and met other young comics who were really going for it, every night. That motivated me. Other people were really trying to make it, why couldn’t I?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgaxi72d001g3h648xh3wpfc@published data-word-count=42><strong>Describe your comedy in five words.</strong><br>Personal, relatable, dense, polished, funny. (I hope.) This question always makes me feel like a psychopath, describing my own style of comedy. Also five words is so many. I’m sorry I used “funny.” I was clearly struggling.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgaxi73c001h3h640hcizcwk@published data-word-count=33><strong>If you weren’t a comedian, what would you be doing?</strong><br>Writing young-adult novels in a cabin. It was not a cool plan, but it’s what I wanted to do when I was a kid.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgaxi73e001i3h64jn241n1e@published data-word-count=41><strong>What of your work do you think you’re best known for?</strong><strong><br></strong>My Netflix special Quarter-Life Crisis. I’m very proud of the way it came together and feel like it’s a good representation of who I was at that time in my life.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgaxi73g001j3h64d1xfahpt@published data-word-count=31><strong>What’s some of your work that you’re most proud of?</strong><strong><br></strong>My Netflix special, my late-night sets, and a project I just sold that I can’t talk about but am very proud of.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgaxi73k001k3h644vk59w9w@published data-word-count=32><strong>How has quarantine affected the way you approach your comedy and your audience?</strong><br>I didn’t go onstage — indoors, outdoors, nothing — for five months. That was crazy. It still is. I’m rusty.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgaxi73t001l3h64efd3322n@published data-word-count=73><strong>What have you done in quarantine for comedy that you thought you would never do? </strong><strong><br></strong>I never would have done sketches on Instagram before quarantine. Not because I think Instagram sketches are dumb, but because I didn’t have the self-esteem to do it. To me, it really feels like putting yourself out there in a big way. Acting is embarrassing for me. Stand-up had to be taken away for me to consider it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgaxi73t001m3h643rrf2n7z@published data-word-count=39><strong>Who are some of your favorite comedians right now? Who is putting out work that excites and inspires you?</strong><strong><br></strong>Maria Bamford is my favorite comedian, but there are so many comedians pivoting during this time in ways that inspire me.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgaxi73u001n3h64tvd4382n@published data-word-count=72><strong>What is the best comedy advice, and then the worst comedy advice, you’ve ever received, either when you were starting out or more recently?</strong><strong><br></strong>The best comedy advice in the beginning of my career was get onstage every night, as many times as possible. It’s the only way to get better. You can’t practice stand-up alone in your room. You can’t find out if a joke works by asking two of your friends.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgaxi73v001o3h64fudhd827@published data-word-count=43><strong>Tell us one story from your childhood that is a good representation of your life.</strong><strong><br></strong>I got my period early and now I’m a comedian; those things are probably connected. And my mom died. Are these the hilarious fun stories you were looking for?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgaxi73v001p3h646e1tpqjh@published data-word-count=55><strong>Assuming quarantine ends at some point, is there anything about the way that comedy or the industry in general has changed that you hope continues post-quarantine?</strong><strong><br></strong>I hope meetings continue to take place on Zoom — especially general meetings. Nobody needs to take a flight and/or sit in traffic to make small talk and drink Dasani.</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckgfort7l000045orf263tvmp@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Comedians You Should and Will Know in 2020</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Taylor Tomlinson Just Wants to Get Onstage Again</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmny1rdilpqtlpKS6rbXNrKanZZmjwaa%2B1aKcsGWTpLqmsMiapaxlqaTCbr%2FHqKylnF2gu7DDjGtna2hencGuuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
