Speaking on Shannon Sharpe on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Club Shay Shay</a>, he shared his thoughts on the reaction.</p><p>“I think some people are upset with me now that I went to work at AEW. I don’t know why. If you’re acknowledging, and you think I’ve contributed to the business, and I know I have because I hear it every day, you would think they would let me do whatever I want to do. As long as it doesn’t affect them. I’m not going to get on TV and say ‘AEW is better,’ I’m not doing something stupid. I’m just working. That’s all I know how to do. They’re mad. Not mad, but they did something…I’ll tell you off camera.”</p><p>Flair recently stated that he would be willing to walk away if he embarrassed AEW or Tony Khan.
