Much to the 44-year-old actor‚Äôs despair, tech and social media have evolved for what seems like the worse, and he seems to hardly keep up with the times ‚Äî but the Internet is living for it. In what has now been known as ‚ÄúGrandpa Ackles,‚Äù fans on Twitter have taken the time to share their favorite moments during the Instagram live, where Ackles appears to just be charmingly lacking social media expertise.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>"emotional trauma" i'm screaming jensen is such a dork i love him so much! he has the whole <a href=#>#thewinchesters</a> gang helping him with the instagram live &lt;3 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/GwAQTvt0yj</a></p>‚Äî jo (@acklesism) <a href=#>November 23, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=600 data-current-count=900 data-injectable=true>The actor appeared frustrated throughout the entire live, struggling to start the video, end it, and everything it required in between- after all, it had been a few good years since he had to do this. Regardless, the The Boys alum kept The Winchester cast near him, giving out a helping hand whenever needed, which is fair to say, was quite often. Fans absolutely loved this interaction between the OG actor and the young group of people now leading the Supernatural prequel, finding it endearing that in spite of only being in his mid-forties, the actor was still struggling so much with technology.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>jojo is helping grandpa jensen with ending his instagram live üòÇ <a href=#>#thewinchesters</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/RMQjPDfA55</a></p>‚Äî melli | fan (@danneelsrainbow) <a href=#>November 23, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>I think I missed the start of Jensen‚Äôs live but HE SHOVED HIS PHONE AT JOJO TO HELP HIM END THE INSTAGRAM LIVE.

The Winchesters tells the tale of Mary Campbell and John Winchester before they got married, showing their beginnings as hunters and their untold love story from Supernatural.</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=573 data-injectable=false>The Winchesters is currently airing on the CW every Tuesday, and if you want to keep with Grandad Ackles, you can find him on the third season of The Boys on Amazon Prime Video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S3prrSnqVmmZOguaa%2FjJ6voaGSnsGqusZmqq2qn6O0brPRmqWdqJFixKq6wqGcrKyVp3q3tcGeqmacpae2r7OMmqVmoZ6owaKz0ZqkZqSZq7Jw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
