He even made it into Tatler's Social Power Index last year, with the publication lauding him for his "fabulous sense of humour" and looking "as good in a suit as he does a kilt."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/11cff947db53-major-johnny-thompson.jpg><p id=eCFw9aOEekp data-wc=72>Lieutenant Colonel Johnny Thompson, who trained with the 5th Battalion Royal Regiment of Scotland, has been reportedly promoted to "super equerry" after impressing King Charles and Queen Camilla in his current role.

Equerries are responsible for the detailed planning and execution of the royals' daily programmes. They accompany monarchs on official engagements, assist with military matters and help his guests during meetings with dignitaries.</p><h2>Clive Alderton</h2><p id=e6KrRLPFMv3 data-wc=71>Considered to be His Majesty's most senior aide, Clive Alderton has been Charles' principal private secretary for years. At the time of his appointment to Clarence House, he was Britain's Ambassador to Morocco but he had previously served Charles and wife Camilla for six years between 2006 and 2012. He first joined the Foreign Office in 1986. His successful career has seen him serve overseas in Poland, Belgium, Singapore and France.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/957932cffa05-gettyimages-1406180680.jpg><p id=ef_Ufhitovp data-wc=67><strong>What is a private secretary?</strong> As the most important member of the Royal Household, the Private Secretary is responsible for supporting the King in his duties as Head of State. Described by the Royal Family as "the channel of communication between the Head of State and the Government", they also liaise with the Armed Forces, the Church and the many organisations of which His Majesty is patron.</p><h2>Nicholas Soames</h2><p id=eqOya5f6qe3 data-wc=47>Sir Nicholas Soames - grandson of Sir Winston Churchill - has been a confidant and close friend to Charles for over 65 years. The pair got to know each other in 1970 when Nicholas was appointed equerry to the royal, a position he held for two years.</p><p id=e7_o_TQu5l4 data-wc=57>Sir Nicholas has said the life of his friend will change now that he has become King. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "As the King said, as he embarks on his new responsibilities, clearly his life will change, and his views and the way that he conducts himself will observe, of course, the constitutional principles.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6e462f413933-prince-charles-nicholas-soames-z.jpg><p id=eIRrcASrLt data-wc=49>"He made absolutely plain that he intends to uphold the constitutional principles at the heart of the nation that he understands very well. The Prince of Wales has served a long apprenticeship at the feet of an absolute master and he knows very well what the constitutional obligations are."</p><p id=eriJ9bt60wR data-wc=39>Charles acted as best man at Nicholas's wedding to heiress Catherine Weatherall in 1981. An observer previously told the Independent that their friendship is based on "a great deal of mutual humour and banter but the utmost public discretion".</p><h2>Norton Knatchbull, 3rd Earl Mountbatten of Burma</h2><p id=e1xn1KFSEZI data-wc=64>Charles has had a close relationship with the Knatchbull family since childhood. The first Earl Mountbatten, Louis, was the uncle of Prince Philip and a mentor of Prince Charles growing up - he famously referred to him as his Honorary Grandfather. Tragically, he was killed alongside his grandson Nicolas by IRA terrorists in 1979 and it was heartbroken Charles who read at his funeral.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b76cbe7e407c-norton-knatchbull.jpg><p id=ecy-LgZMfLpL data-wc=39>Louis's grandson Norton, meanwhile, has a very strong bond with Charles. He was chosen to be one of Prince William's godparents - Prince Philip was his godfather - while his daughter Lady Alexandra was a goddaughter of Princess Diana.</p><p id=ebTElOQoh9n5 data-wc=68>The bond between the families was especially evident in June 2016 when Charles walked Alexandra down the aisle on her wedding day. At the time her father was too ill to take on the role himself. The society nuptials had an incredible guest list that included the Queen and Prince Philip, Princess Anne, Queen Sofia of Spain and the former King Constantine II and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece.</p><h2>Lord Chamberlain - Andrew David Parker</h2><p id=ej3kqp_AZnY_ data-wc=39>Andrew David Parker, Baron Parker of Minsmere, served as Director General of MI5 from 2013 to 2020. He assumed the role of Lord Chamberlain on April 1 after Earl Peel, who had served in the post for 14 years.</p><p id=eY9XIKDRCoiv data-wc=35>As the most senior official in the royal household, Andrew is responsible for organising the King's ceremonial and public programme. This typically includes organising garden parties, state visits, royal weddings and state openings of parliament.</p><h2>Peter St Clair-Erskine</h2><p id=eh1wHMDNsNL3 data-wc=42>Peter St Clair-Erskine started working for Charles and Camilla as Master of the Household at Clarence House in 2014.
