When things ran smoothly, production was wrapped up in three hours. However, at times, that wasn't always the case...</p><p>Kaley Cuoco admitted certain scenes weren't exactly easy to shoot. Cuoco recalled the 'Strawberry Pop Tart' scenes taking ages to shoot alongside Johnny Galecki. According to Cuoco, <a href=#>last minute changes were made to the script and she just couldn't get it together.</a></p><p>She tells TV Line, "Funny enough, The Gorilla Dissolutionthey wrote that Pop Tart line at the very last minute and I couldn’t remember it! I kept flubbing it, making everyone laugh, to the point that I was like, “OK, this is taking the charm out of the scene!”</p><p>Nonetheless, Kaley revealed it all went well in the end, "But it ended up being so cute, and the audience was going crazy, standing and cheering…. We had to keep telling them to calm down, but they had waited so long for it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>How The Big Bang Theory's Chuck Lorre Broke The Awkward Tension Between Kaley Cuoco And Johnny Galecki After Their Breakup</a></span></p><p>Quite the moment on the show, and one fans had a blast with.</p><h2 id=on-average-a-big-bang-theory-scene-was-shot-at-least-twice>On Average, A Big Bang Theory Scene Was Shot At Least Twice</h2><p>Thanks to author J.W.

Studio in Burbank, California, detailing some neat behind the scenes details.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Among some interesting tweaks to take place, included the stagehands putting grape juice in the wine bottle for Penny's scene, and constantly filling it back up between takes.</p><p>Lynne revealed that the process on the day was a smooth one, lasting three hours. In addition, each scene was shot at least twice.</p><p>She wrote, "I never lost interest in the filming, even though every scene was performed at least twice. The writing, the acting, and the funny changes to the dialogue kept my attention. Also, there was an energy inside the soundstage.

I would have to say that Simon’s humor gets me every single time. We’ve all had our moments when we break and those will undoubtedly be in the blooper reel."</p><p><a href=#>Kaley Cuoco was another cast member to agree</a> with Helberg being the best of the bunch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Simon Helberg (who plays Howard) makes me laugh, really, really hard.
