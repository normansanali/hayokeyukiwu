Learn how to choose the best-smelling shampoo in 2023 and key features to be aware of, and learn top tips and tricks to fully enjoy your shampoo.</p><h3>How to choose the best-smelling shampoo</h3><p>There are key features that make up a great-smelling shampoo that will help you make a perfect choice. Be aware of important factors like ingredients, hair type, and scent preference.</p><h4>Ingredients your hair will love</h4><p>Allow your hair to soak up good, hair-loving ingredients. If you don’t have much time to find a new shampoo formula, look for products labeled vegan, organic, or all-natural. While they may still contain a few unwanted ingredients, they’re likely formulated with hair-safe ingredients from natural plants and botanical-based materials.</p><h4>Ingredients to avoid</h4><p>You need to know the low-down on harsh, toxic chemicals in many popular shampoos. High-quality ingredients make self-care products more expensive and often have shorter shelf lives. That’s why many drug and grocery store brands use cheap filler ingredients to cut costs and extend shelf life, making it more affordable.</p><p>Common ingredients to avoid include sulfates, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, synthetic dyes, artificial fragrances, lanolin, and mineral oil. Many of these fillers kill bacteria and fungi in a product, giving the shampoo a longer shelf life.</p><p>Keep an eye out for artificial fragrances while you’re shopping. They create long-lasting, powerful scents, but the ingredients used to make the scents are often irritating, drying, and harsh on the hair and scalp. If possible, try to use a shampoo with natural essential oils or botanical extracts.</p><h4>Identify your scent preference</h4><p>Choosing a scented shampoo is much like picking a new cologne or perfume. You know everyone will smell it, and people may form opinions based on the smell.</p><p>If you’re hoping to layer other fragrances on top of your shampoo scent, choose a light, airy smell that doesn’t overpower. For those hoping to use a shampoo that’ll become your signature scent, double-check that it also treats your specific hair concerns and won’t irritate your hair or scalp.</p><p>While browsing, have an idea of what scent you think works best for your lifestyle. This will help you narrow down a few favorites to choose from.</p><h4>Understand your hair type</h4><p>While it’s great to have incredible-smelling hair, it’s even better to have healthy, happy tresses. Understanding your hair type will help you identify the perfect shampoo for your hair, and then you can narrow down your search by scent.</p><p>People with dry, thick, curly, coily, kinky, or coarse hair should use thicker hydrating and moisturizing shampoos to maintain proper moisture levels. Anyone with oily, thin, or fine hair should use lightweight moisturizing shampoos that won’t leave the hair saturated and greasy.</p><p>Those with specific issues like flakiness, frizz, dandruff, and other hair problems should first identify what shampoo formula best treats these problems.</p><h4>Meet its match</h4><p>For every shampoo you come across, there’s—almost always—a matching conditioner that compliments it. If you’re interested in the poo, use the matching conditioner for the best results. Each shampoo and conditioner bottle uses complimenting ingredients that support, strengthen, or hydrate your hair.</p><h3>Our top tips and tricks for shampoo (and how to smell your best)</h3><p>Are you interested in smelling even better? With our top tips and tricks for shampoo and hair hygiene, you’ll be the best-smelling person in every room.</p><h4>Use one product at a time</h4><p>When it comes to looking and smelling your best, using fewer products is better than using too many. This also applies to your hair. Layering up too many products may cause a mix of scents<i> and</i> create product buildup on your hair and scalp.</p><p>The build-up of hair products causes the hair to look weighed down and greasy, affecting how your shampoo smells. Keep it simple by using high-quality hair care products in moderate amounts. You should only use one or two products to achieve your desired results, especially if you use the right products for your hair type.</p><p>Shampoos with natural, organic ingredients are safe for their hair and give it a healthy, natural scent. If you are using natural, high-quality shampoo, be sure not to use harsh hair products on top, as this can cause damage to the hair and scalp.</p><h4>How often to wash your hair</h4><p>How often you wash your hair depends on your hair type and texture. That said, you want to find the delicate balance between washing and not washing your hair. There should be a perfect “middle ground” of how many times to wash your hair each week to smell fresh and fabulous without drying out the hair or causing stress or damage.</p><p>Finding your perfect number of washes per week will take trial and error to uncover. Here are a few common suggestions from haircare experts: Those with fine, thin, or oily hair typically wash it once daily or every three days. Those with thick, coarse, curly, or kinky hair wash their hair less frequently. Usually, once every three to five days, while some wash it once per week. It really depends on your lifestyle and how dirty your hair gets. Folks with damaged hair should try to go further in-between washes and be sure to use a hydrating shampoo and conditioner.</p><h4>Stay away from heat</h4><p>Protect your hair and see faster improvements with your shampoo by avoiding the heat. Heat damages the hair and causes frizziness, breakage, and stresses out your strands. Avoid heat from styling tools, and use lukewarm or cool water while washing your hair.</p><h4>Rinse, rinse, rinse</h4><p>When you cleanse your hair, rinse away all the soap from your hair thoroughly. Stick your head under the shower head for one to two minutes (using lukewarm water) to ensure the product residue is completely removed from your scalp and hair.</p><p>After hopping out of the shower, it can be hard to remove leftover shampoo residue, and it can cause a change in the scent or how your hair appears.</p><h2>Frequently asked questions</h2><h3>Can I use dry shampoo instead of liquid shampoo?</h3><p>Definitely, if you’re short on time, you can use dry shampoo to revive and refresh your hair. Dry shampoo is an absorbent product that soaks up excess oil, grease, and dirt on your scalp. It’s a hard-working powder that draws out impurities and often comes with an incredible scent. While dry shampoo is a great way to revive your hair for an extra day and hide oil and grease streaks, it’s not a replacement for washing your hair with a real liquid or bar shampoo. Dry shampoo doesn’t remove product buildup. In fact, it adds to it. So when you do find the time to hop into the shower and give your hair an intense wash, we recommend washing your hair twice to remove all of the product build-up. Not removing all of the buildup may affect your hair follicles, strength, and how your hair grows.</p><h3>What makes my hair smell bad?</h3><p>Everything from sweat, pollutants, dirt, product residue, and eating habits can make your hair smell funky. These different factors can build up on your scalp and hair and leave it smelling stinky. One factor to be aware of is product buildup. If you use multiple styling products but have many days between washes, the products will likely build up on your scalp and cause unwanted odors. Be aware that products like dry shampoo also contribute to a smelly scalp or head, even though they often cover up scent problems when first applied. The best way to take care of bad-smelling hair and scalp is to find the ideal number of washes per week that your hair needs. This ensures it doesn’t get stinky and stays fresh all week long.</p><h3>Will my shampoo expire?</h3><p>Yes, your shampoo will expire. All self-care products, including liquid shampoo, dry shampoo, and shampoo bars, have an expiration date. Check the side or bottom of each product to see if there is a printed expiration date. Most self-care products will have an expiration date listed on them. If your product doesn’t have one, check for signs that your product has gone bad. These can include a change in scent, color, texture, or effectiveness. If you suspect your product has passed its expiration date, throw it away and purchase a new one. It’s not worth using expired products because they may contain harmful bacteria or fungi.</p><h3>What’s the best-smelling shampoo in 2023?</h3><p>The winner of the best-smelling shampoo in 2023 is <a href=#>Blu Atlas Coconut Apricot Shampoo</a>. Coconut Apricot Shampoo is the perfect pick if you want to smell like tropical sunshine, fruit, and your next dream vacation. While the scent is incredible, it’s also a great cleanser that effectively cleans your hair without causing distress.
