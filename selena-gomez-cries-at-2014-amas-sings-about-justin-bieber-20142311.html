The crowd, meanwhile, appeared stunned to see the singer perform with such raw emotion, but it was something Gomez’s close confidante <a href=#><strong>Swift</strong></a> understood. Cameras flashed to the “Blank Space” singer of her looking sympathetically at her friend from the audience.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=527 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="selena gomez and taylor swift american music awards" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Gomez recently admitted On Air with Ryan Seacrest that Bieber <a href=#>was actually a fan of her new single</a>. “He thought it was beautiful. I think it was really hard. I think he was a little jealous of the video guy at first,” she joked. “Honestly, music is an expression, and if you will be that voice for these girls, there are some people that feel this. This is universal.”</p><p>Watch her emotional performance above and tell <strong>Us</strong>: What did you think?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqepJWjrm6zzqacs2WTp7amv4yaq2ZqYGaBbq3Mmqpmq5mjtLR5wJumrqxdn8K0wMinZJuhlZeys3mRaWhtamNmfnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
