Dipping into the excellent okra soup and jollof rice at the Island Grill, a newish Nigerian restaurant in Duluth, I was reminded of Southern gumbos and Savannah red rice — up to a point."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Nor can we describe West African food from a strictly Western point of view. Egusi soup; gbegiri and ewedu; edikang ikong: If you are as unschooled as I am, you’ll need to do a little homework.</p><span class=prefix>Explore</span><a class=headline href=#>Metro Atlanta restaurant reviews</a><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Wendell Brock</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ajc.com/things-to-do/atlanta-restaurant-blog/review-island-grill-brings-the-complex-flavors-of-nigeria-to-duluth/SKI7RKPXN5GRLDHLENNQ5AG6G4/%5Bobject%20Object%5D alt="icon to expand image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Wendell Brock</p><p class=story-text data-index=8>But, don’t be intimidated. It’s OK to ask the staff, or Google while you peruse the menu.</p><p class=story-text data-index=9>After a couple of visits to the Island Grill, I’m intrigued by the complexities of a cuisine that derives its richness from fatty cuts of beef and goat (and sometimes palm oil), its smoky allure from dried fish, its fire from a variety of peppers, and its funky tang from fermented ingredients. And, I haven’t even mentioned the starches — pounded yam, wheat-meal fufu, garri (smashed cassava root) and amala (reconstituted yam flour). Most of these grains are shaped into pudgy wet pillows. Pinch a piece off with your fingers, roll it into a ball, and use it to temper the sting of a spicy stew — or, to soak up <i>more</i> gravy.</p><p class=story-text data-index=11>I recommend you start with the most common Nigerian street snack: suya. Strips of beef, traditionally seasoned with spices and peanut powder, are grilled and served with raw onion and more dry spice, for dipping. Stab a slice with a toothpick, drag it gently through the spice mixture, and eat it with a bite of the onion. It’s irresistible. (To go with it, I suggest Trophy, an easy-drinking Nigerian lager that comes in a jumbo bottle.)</p><span class=prefix>Explore</span><a class=headline href=#>Gwinnett County dining news</a><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Wendell Brock</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ajc.com/things-to-do/atlanta-restaurant-blog/review-island-grill-brings-the-complex-flavors-of-nigeria-to-duluth/SKI7RKPXN5GRLDHLENNQ5AG6G4/%5Bobject%20Object%5D alt="icon to expand image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Wendell Brock</p><p class=story-text data-index=15>Another essential starter is the moi moi (sometimes called moin moin), a lovely steamed pudding made of rehydrated dried beans that takes its pinkish color from red peppers and dried crawfish. The version here is an elegant little mold, studded with boiled egg and dainty little fish. Only a highly competent cook could execute such a masterful moi moi.</p><p class=story-text data-index=16>The jollof also was delicious — sweet, savory, smoky. We requested it with fried mackerel, which came smothered in tomato sauce. The fish was fine, if a bit bony and strong tasting. As much as we loved the deeply flavorful okra soup (not the least bit slimy), our chosen protein of braised goat was rather chewy. One would expect more from a $29 soup. While we asked for fufu to go with the soup, I’m pretty certain we got pounded yam, a fluffy, plain-tasting mash formed into a ball, reminiscent of mashed potatoes, but firmer.</p><p class=story-text data-index=17>On my second visit, I tried the classic soup efo riro, and loved the haunting, smoky funk of locust beans, hot green pepper and stewed amaranth greens. Because the menu states that the dish includes a starch ball, I was puzzled to see I’d been charged $4 for a side of pounded yam. I also requested chicken with this dish, but it came with mixed meat — tripe, goat, etc. Ayamase was perhaps the most ambitious plate I tried — a bright, fiery melange of spinach, tomato, peppers and various meats (chicken mostly). Plain, par-boiled rice accompanied the dish; I also liked it with scoops of pounded yam.</p><p class=story-text data-index=18>Mix-ups aside, the Island Grill was a mostly satisfactory experience. The meal arrived quickly on one visit, but took a good bit longer on the second. The restaurant has a bar, and is equipped for Friday night dance parties. Our server told us we should come back for the fun.</p><p class=story-text data-index=21>In a part of town known for an abundance of Asian restaurants, it’s good to see Africa representing, too.</p><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Wendell Brock</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ajc.com/things-to-do/atlanta-restaurant-blog/review-island-grill-brings-the-complex-flavors-of-nigeria-to-duluth/SKI7RKPXN5GRLDHLENNQ5AG6G4/%5Bobject%20Object%5D alt="icon to expand image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Wendell Brock</p><p class=story-text data-index=23><b>THE ISLAND GRILL</b></p><p class=story-text data-index=24><b>Food: </b>classic Nigerian, with a few surprises, such as noodles and shawarma</p><p class=story-text data-index=25><b>Service: </b>nice enough, but more attention could be paid to customer requests</p><p class=story-text data-index=27><b>Best dishes: </b>suya, moi moi, jollof rice, efo riro, okra soup</p><p class=story-text data-index=28><b>Vegetarian selections:</b> ask before you risk it; this is a meat-heavy cuisine, and management never responded to our requests for more information</p><p class=story-text data-index=29><b>Alcohol: </b>full bar</p><p class=story-text data-index=30><b>Price range:</b> $$$</p><p class=story-text data-index=31><b>Credit cards: </b>all major cards accepted</p><p class=story-text data-index=33><b>Hours:</b> 12-10 p.m. Tuesdays-Thursdays. 12-11 p.m. Fridays-Saturdays. 12-9 p.m. Sundays</p><p class=story-text data-index=34><b>Children:</b> yes</p><p class=story-text data-index=35><b>Parking:</b> free in lot</p><p class=story-text data-index=36><b>MARTA station:</b> no</p><p class=story-text data-index=37><b>Reservations: </b>yes</p><p class=story-text data-index=39><b>Wheelchair access: </b>yes</p><p class=story-text data-index=40><b>Noise level: </b>low, though we never witnessed the Friday night dance party</p><p class=story-text data-index=41><b>Takeout: </b>yes</p><p class=story-text data-index=42><b>Address, phone: </b>3665 Club Drive, Duluth. 404-600-4155</p><p class=story-text data-index=43><b>Website: </b><a href=#>theislandgrillduluth.com/menu</a></p><span class=prefix>Explore</span><a class=headline href=#>The ultimate guide to pizza in Atlanta</a><p class=story-text data-index=46><a href=#>Sign up for the AJC Food and Dining Newsletter</a></p><p class=story-text data-index=47><b>Read more stories like this by&nbsp;</b><a href=#><b>liking Atlanta Restaurant Scene on Facebook</b></a><b>, following&nbsp;</b><a href=#><b>@ATLDiningNews on Twitter</b></a><b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</b><a href=#><b>@ajcdining on Instagram</b></a><b>.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orbCZ5qopV%2Bptaq6xqxkraddmbxwrdOlmKeskWK%2Fpr%2FTmqyrmZ6peqO4zqBmq52mnrK4eciso5qmlGK0s7XLpWSbqpmjtLR506GcZpufor2tsddmnaWZpqS%2FtHnOn2SnoZeav6qtjK2mZpylocK1tI6MgoJvgoCdmZqUgImFfHiBko%2BasG54gG53aXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
