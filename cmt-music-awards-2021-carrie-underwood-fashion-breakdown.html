Carrie Underwood stepped on stage at the 2021 CMT Awards on Wednesday, June 9, in some blinding bling. 
For her performance with NEEDTOBREATHE, the 38-year-old country star dazzled in a Nicolas Jebran suit from the Spring Summer 2020 Silent Conversation Collection. And get this: every single inch was covered in sequins! 
The glitzy getup blended black and white sequins along the blazer and pants.

And when it came makeup, she stayed true to the sparkly theme. The CALIA founder rocked a smoky eye with silver glitter pigment across the lid and a glossy pink lip.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The men of NEEDTOBREATH — <strong>Bo Rinehart</strong>, <strong>Bear Rinehart</strong>, <strong>Seth Bolt</strong>, <strong>Josh Lovelace</strong> and <strong>Joe Stillwell</strong> — clearly got the color coordination memo, too.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>For their performance of “I Wanna Remember” with Underwood, the men wore all-black ensembles, spicing up their attire with cowboy hats and necklaces.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>NEEDTOBREATH first announced their “I Wanna Remember” collaboration with Underwood in May, as it will be a part of their album Into the Mystery, which is set to be released on July 30.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“‘I Wanna Remember’ is a nostalgic track that takes you back to the moments you never want to forget. We all came from small towns, and those roots have cemented into the fabric of the band and our music,” the band said at the time. “We felt like [Underwood’s] small town roots and humble beginnings were the perfect addition to this song.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>While Underwood took the stage with the Christian rock band at the CMT Awards, she sang solo the day prior at the Grand Ole Opry.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“It felt soooo good to perform in front of people for the first time in what feels like forever! Thanks, @opry for having us … tonight was magic,” she captioned her tweet, sharing pictures from her performance.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>For her return to stage, she stunned in a strapless midi-length dress.
