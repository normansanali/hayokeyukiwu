The courts didn’t hold back, slapping him with a whopping 28-year prison sentence back in January 2012.</p><p>But that’s not all, folks. Joran Van der Sloot is also the prime suspect in the mysterious disappearance of American citizen Natalee Holloway.</p><p>The 19-year-old Natalee mysteriously vanished without a trace during a trip to Aruba, and her case has remained a heart-wrenching enigma ever since.</p><p>On May 30, 2005, she was officially declared missing, and the grim declaration of her death was made on January 12, 2012, sending shockwaves around the world.</p><p>But wait, there’s more! Van Der Sloot has a laundry list of charges against him. From wire fraud to extortion, it seems he’s dabbled in just about every criminal activity you can think of.</p><p>Even behind bars, this guy couldn’t keep his nose clean. He attempted to smuggle drugs, specifically cocaine, which promptly earned him an extra 18 years of imprisonment. It’s safe to say he’s not winning any popularity contests in the penitentiary.</p><p>Now, fast forward to May 2023, and Joran Van der Sloot is making headlines once again. Peru’s government has given the green light for his extradition to the United States. This unexpected development has rekindled hope among Natalee Holloway’s grief-stricken family for justice to finally be served.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Joran van der Sloot is expected to plead guilty</strong></h2><p>Almost two decades after the disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway in Aruba, there’s a surprising turn of events. The prime suspect in her case, Joran van der Sloot, a Dutch citizen, is set to reveal long-awaited information about what happened to Natalee.</p><p>However, this revelation is not directly related to Natalee’s case. Van der Sloot is now facing charges of extortion and fraud against Natalee’s mother, and he’s expected to plead guilty in a US federal court during a hearing scheduled for Wednesday. The news was confirmed by John Q. Kelly, the attorney representing the Holloway family.</p><p>The exact nature of the extortion charges and the potential sentencing are still uncertain. But what we do know is that van der Sloot intends to admit his guilt regarding these charges.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Joran Van der Sloot with Deepak Kalpoe and Satish Kalpoe" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Joran-Van-der-Sloot-with-Deepak-Kalpoe-and-Satish-Kalpoe.webp alt="Joran Van der Sloot with Deepak Kalpoe and Satish Kalpoe" width=400 height=373 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>The Mysterious Disappearance of Natalee Holloway</strong></h2><p>On a seemingly ordinary night, May 29, 2005, to be precise, Natalee Holloway went out with Joran Van der Sloot, along with two brothers, Deepak Kalpoe and Satish Kalpoe, to Carlos ‘n Charlie’s bar in Oranjestad, Aruba. They were having a good time, but little did anyone know that this night would mark the beginning of a perplexing mystery.</p><p>As the clock struck 1:00 am, the bar closed its doors, and Natalee was last seen leaving with Joran and the Kalpoe brothers. What happened next has left us with more questions than answers.</p><p>Fast forward to June 9, 2005, and the authorities shocked the world by arresting Joran Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers in connection with Natalee’s disappearance. The case took an even more puzzling turn when the Kalpoe brothers were released from custody on July 4, but Joran Van der Sloot remained in custody, intensifying suspicions around his involvement.</p><p>As the investigation unfolded, the Kalpoe brothers found themselves back in custody on August 26, this time on charges of rape and murder. It seemed like justice might be served, but the world was in for another twist.</p><p>On September 3, all three suspects were released due to insufficient evidence. It was a frustrating moment for those seeking answers. Joran Van der Sloot was released but with travel restrictions, confining him to Dutch territory while the investigation continued.</p><p>However, Van der Sloot had different plans. On September 5, 2005, he returned to the Netherlands to pursue his education, enrolling in international business management studies at HAN University of Applied Sciences. Just when it seemed like the case was going cold, a higher court lifted the travel restrictions on him on September 14.</p><p>Read Also: <a href=# rel=noopener>Professor Seth Crosby Wiki, Age, Wife, Kids, Salary, Net Worth and More</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Joran-Van-der-Sloot.webp><h2><strong>Peter de Vries did </strong><strong>Sting Operation on </strong><strong>Joran Van der Sloot</strong></h2><p>On February 3, 2008, Dutch television aired an undercover video by journalist Peter de Vries that had a bombshell revelation. The video featured Joran Van der Sloot, a key figure in the Natalee Holloway disappearance case, admitting to some chilling details.</p><p>In this covert operation, a guy named Patrick van der, working alongside Peter de Vries, posed as a friend of Van der Sloot. Van der Sloot had no idea that he was being recorded as he spilled the beans on a harrowing story. He confessed that Natalee Holloway had a seizure during a sexual encounter on the beach.</p><p>The most disturbing part of the confession was what happened next. Instead of seeking help or calling the authorities, Van der Sloot revealed that he got in touch with a friend named Daury. Together, they loaded Natalee’s lifeless body onto a boat and heartlessly disposed of her in the sea. It’s a chilling revelation about what might have happened that night.</p><p>But there’s a twist to this already baffling story. Van der Sloot later claimed that he made up the story to impress someone he thought was a drug dealer named Eem. This flip-flop in his confession leaves us all wondering about the truth in this twisted tale.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Natalee Holloway killer Joran Van der Sloot" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Natalee-Holloway-killer-Joran-Van-der-Sloot.webp alt="Natalee Holloway killer Joran Van der Sloot" width=400 height=266 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Joran Van der Sloot’s Shocking Confession on Fox News</strong></h2><p>On that fateful day, November 24, 2008, a story unfolded that would send shockwaves across the nation. Joran Van der Sloot, known for his connection to the Natalee Holloway case, sat down for an interview on Fox News’s “On the Record,” and what he revealed was nothing short of astounding.</p><p>In an astonishing turn of events, Van der Sloot confessed to something that shook the public’s faith in humanity. He admitted to the unthinkable – selling Natalee Holloway into sexual slavery. His harrowing account unveiled a deeply disturbing world of deception and corruption that had remained hidden for far too long.</p><p>Van der Sloot’s confession included the chilling revelation that he had received money for orchestrating Holloway’s abduction and her subsequent horrifying ordeal in the world of human trafficking. This was a moment that left the entire nation in disbelief.</p><p>But the unsettling tale didn’t end there. Van der Sloot implicated others in this horrifying act, claiming that he had enlisted the help of the Kalpoe brothers. Furthermore, he suggested that his own father, Paulus Van der Sloot, had a hand in covering up the crime. It was a revelation that left everyone questioning how deep this darkness ran.</p><p>In this distressing interview, the public also heard excerpts from an audio recording that Van der Sloot provided. This recording was a phone conversation between him and his father, Paulus, in which the elder Van der Sloot seemed to have an unsettling knowledge of his son’s involvement in this nightmarish world of human trafficking.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Joran Van der Sloot Stephany Flores Ramírez" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Joran-Van-der-Sloot-Stephany-Flores-Ramirez-.webp alt="Joran Van der Sloot Stephany Flores Ramírez" width=400 height=275 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Murder of Stephany Flores Ramírez</strong></h2><p>On, May 30, 2010, a young 21-year-old named Stephany Tatiana Flores Ramírez met a horrifying end in room 309 of Lima’s Hotel TAC, located in the Miraflores District. The shocking discovery was made on June 2 when a hotel employee found her lifeless and battered body.</p><p>What added a disturbing twist to the tale was the fact that the room had been registered under the name of Joran Van der Sloot, who had already checked out of the hotel, leaving the room key behind and the TV on.</p><p>As investigators dug deeper into the case, they found unsettling evidence that pointed towards Van der Sloot. A tennis racquet, found near the victim, was suspected to be the murder weapon according to the coroner. Witnesses came forward, testifying that they had seen Van der Sloot and the victim together as they entered the hotel room.</p><p>Surveillance footage from the Atlantic City Casino in Lima showed Van der Sloot and the victim playing cards together on the night before the tragic event, solidifying his connection to the crime. Eventually, he was apprehended and sentenced to 28 years in prison.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Joran Van der Sloot father Paul van der Sloot" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Joran-Van-der-Sloot-father-Paul-van-der-Sloot.webp alt="Joran Van der Sloot father Paul van der Sloot" width=400 height=276 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Joran Van der Sloot Family Background</strong></h2><p>On August 6, 1987 Joran Van der Sloot, was in Arnhem, Netherlands.

His father, Paulus, was a lawyer, while his mother, Anita, was an art teacher. A seemingly ordinary family, but secrets lurked beneath the surface.</p><p>The Van der Sloot family didn’t stay put in the Netherlands for long. They uprooted and moved to the sunny shores of Aruba. It was on this picturesque island that Joran’s life took a dramatic turn.</p><p>While studying at the International School of Aruba, Van Der Sloot wasn’t just an average student. He excelled both in the classroom and on the sports field. As a sports prodigy, he proudly represented his school on the soccer pitch and clinched victory in numerous tennis tournaments.</p><p>But here’s where things get dicey. In the shadows of the Caribbean night, the allure of gambling began to captivate the young Van der Sloot.
