She has also starred in multiple blockbuster films winning countless awards. First, however, here are <a href=#>Sarah Jessica Parker’s top four highest-rated movies and tv shows</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sex_and_The_City></span><strong>Sex and The City</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>From 1998 to 2004, “Sex and The City” dominated as one of the best and most popular late-night TV shows. The series follows a New York Sex Columnist Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), and her three friends, Samantha (Kim Cattrall), Charlotte (Kristin Davis), and Miranda ( Cynthia Nixon), as they explore the Manhattan dating scene.&nbsp;</p><p>The series became iconic for more than just the ladies getting involved with different men every week. <a href=#>Instead, its fashion, endless cocktails, and raunchy sex scenes bound together</a> to create a unique series that remained iconic after its stopped airing.</p><p>“Sex and The City” <a href=#>launched Sarah Jessica Parker into superstardom</a>, and she earned huge plaudits for her acting and the fashion displayed in the show. The series also earned her multiple Golden Globe awards.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ed_Wood></span><strong>Ed Wood</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/a7/37/99/a7379939d97f1bbdddf2cabf53bd50c4.jpg><p>Tim Burton’s “Ed Wood,” is a biography about film director Ed Wood Jr. (1924-78), who was unusually famous for making exceptionally bad films. The movie stars Johnny Depp as (Ed Wood), an aspiring director-writer playwright who continuously makes one bad movie after another. Sarah Jessica Parker starred as Wood’s girlfriend (Dolores) in the film.</p><p>The biopic received huge plaudits for <a href=#>its unusual theme of paying homage to one of Hollywood’s worst directors</a>. Also, its focus on the delusion of Wood, who wouldn’t agree he just wasn’t good enough, was a bizarre but unique film theme. Although the film didn’t do well at the box office, it is considered one of the best biopics ever.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=State_and_Main></span><strong>State and Main</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>“State and Main” tells the story of movie director Walt Price (William H. Macy) and his movie crew, who arrive in Waterford, New Hampshire, to film an important scene featuring the town’s famous old mill. However, the situation became complicated when the crew learned the old mill had burned down.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, Price tells screenwriter Joe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to rewrite the scene even though the movie’s title is “Old Mill.” First, however, Price and the movie’s producer, Marty (David Paymer), try to make thighs work out, <a href=#>including convincing young star Claire (Sarah Jessica Parker) to do a nude scene</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The 2001 movie earned huge compliments for its comedy and chaotic display of filmmaking. However, “State and Main” also made fun of the movie industry light-heartedly. Still, the film only made about $6.9 million at the U.S. box office.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Divorce></span><strong>Divorce</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/736x/d2/18/76/d218766306e0dea9c187ecee15addf18.jpg><p>HBO’s comedy sitcom “Divorce” premiered on October 9, 2016, as a partial sequel to “Sex and The City.” The series tells the story of Frances (Jessica Parker), who is reevaluating her life due to the toll of raising two children and a strained relationship with her husband, Robert (Thomas Haden Church), after ten years of marriage.</p><p>Frances juxtaposes her life with her successful friend Diane, who has no children. She also considers how her life would be if she were like her other friend Dallas a widow and divorcee. However, she soon realizes that starting afresh is harder than she thought.&nbsp;<br>“Divorce” paints the struggles of a middle-aged couple living in the suburbs of New York.
