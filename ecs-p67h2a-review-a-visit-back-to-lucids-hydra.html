World in Conflict<br>43. Wolfschanze 2</p><p>This is rather disappointing.&nbsp; Using the Hydra solution as an SLI certification bypass doesn't really work if there are only this many applications that the system supports.</p><p>Nevertheless, we've tested it on a few programs - Alien vs. Predator, Hawx, Far Cry 2, and a synthetic, 3D Mark Vantage.&nbsp; I've put a synthetic in there for one reason - it should give an indication of the maximum performance a combined multi-GPU setup should give.&nbsp; A synthetic doesn't really mimic real-world performance, as the algorithms used in them will try and use all the GPU capabilities all the time, but as an upper rung it might be worth taking a look.</p><p>For the tests, ECS provided us with a pair of their GTX 580 GPUs, which are the default factory versions with ECS stickers.&nbsp; Using these in conjunction with a pair of HD 5850s allows the following GPU combinations:</p><table border=0 width=100%><tbody><tr><td bgcolor=#016a96 class=contentwhite><strong>GPU 1</strong></td><td bgcolor=#016a96 class=contentwhite><strong>GPU 2</strong></td><td bgcolor=#016a96 class=contentwhite><strong>GPU 3</strong></td><td bgcolor=#016a96 class=contentwhite><strong>Hydra / CrossFire</strong></td></tr><tr><td>580</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>5850</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>580</td><td>580</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Hydra</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>5850</td><td>5850</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Hydra</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>5850</td><td>5850</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>CrossFire</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>580</td><td>5850</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Hydra</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>5850</td><td>580</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Hydra</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>580</td><td>5850</td><td>5850</td><td>Hydra</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>5850</td><td>580</td><td>5850</td><td>Hydra</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>5850</td><td>5850</td><td>580</td><td>Hydra</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>5850</td><td>580</td><td>580</td><td>Hydra</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>580</td><td>5850</td><td>580</td><td>Hydra</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>580</td><td>580</td><td>5850</td><td>Hydra</td></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>The reason for doing combinations such as 580+5850+5850, 5850+580+5850 and 5850+5850+580 are both for compatibility and to see if moving PCIe slots (and going from 16x to 8x lanes) makes a difference.&nbsp; Hypothetically speaking, we would expect the system to work best when the most powerful cards are first in the list.</p><p><strong>3DMark Vantage</strong></p><p>Now for some results - first, 3DMark Vantage.&nbsp; Here we take the GPU score of the benchmark:</p><p><img alt="Hydra - 3DMark Vantage" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph4522/39794.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Quite a few issues come through here:</p><p>- A single 580 is better than a 5850+580 combination in Hydra<br>- The 580+5850 combination outperforms the 5850+580 due to the more powerful card being first<br>- 5850+5850 in Hydra beats the same combination in CrossFire<br>- All the three card setups perform roughly the same.<br>- Two 580s in Hydra outperform all the three card setups.</p><p><strong>Aliens vs. Predator</strong></p><p>For DirectX11, we've taken the Aliens vs. Predator benchmark, and run through the GPU combinations:</p><p><img alt="Hydra - Aliens vs. Predator" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph4522/39795.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This time, other issues arise:</p><p>- When using two 5850s in a three card setup, if a 5850 was in the first slot, the program would not recognise the 580 and run in AMD only mode.<br>- A similar occurrence happened when two 580s were used with a 5850, but only when the 5850 was in slot three.&nbsp; In this configuration, the application would run in NVIDIA only mode.<br>- The 5850+580+580 mode gave the same value as the 5850+580 mode, suggesting the third GPU was not detected properly by Hydra.<br>- The 5850+5850 Crossfire combination beat the 5850+5850 Hydra score, unlike in 3DMark Vantage.<br>- The 580+5850+580 three card setup outperformed all the other three card setups, but was still beaten by two 580s in Hydra mode.</p><p><strong>Hawx:</strong></p><p>For a real world DirectX10 benchmark, we chose Hawx, the action/flight simulator.&nbsp; Using the internal benchmark in DirectX 10.1 mode, with all the settings turned up to max at 1920x1080, the following results were achieved:</p><p><img alt="Hydra - Hawx" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph4522/39819.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Unfortunately, there were quite a few issues running Hawx in many of the modes.&nbsp; In all the three card modes, some long distance texture flickering was observed:</p><p>- 5850+580 Hawx: flickering<br>- 5850+580+580 Hawx: flickering<br>- 5850+580+5850 Hawx: flickering<br>- 5850+5850+580 Hawx: flickering<br>- 580+5850+5850 Hawx: flickering<br>- 580+580+5850 Hawx : flickering<br>- 580+5850+580 Hawx: stutter, flickering</p><p>Ultimately, all these three card modes performed similarly anyway (118 -129 FPS).&nbsp; The dual 580 Hydra still comes top here, but the 580+5850 setup beats all the three card setups as well.</p><p><strong>FarCry 2:</strong></p><p>Our last test was FarCry 2, using the built-in GPU benchmark, looped 4 times and an average taken.&nbsp; Unfortunately, despite being a supported application on the Hydra platform, results were very poor all around:</p><p><img alt="Hydra - FarCry 2" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph4522/39820.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The issues found in Aliens vs. Predator with combination card setups running in AMD or NVIDIA mode surfaced here as well.&nbsp; But even more astonishing is that every Hydra setup failed to give a boost in performance.&nbsp; It seems that they have all defaulted to a 5850 - and even the dual 580 Hydra setup performed worse than a single 580.&nbsp; The only card combinations worth working were the single card setups and the two 5850s in Crossfire.</p><p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p><p>The Hydra solution is still a long way from being viable and commonplace on motherboards.&nbsp; It is a sneaky way around SLI certification, but only on a few products.&nbsp; As it also supplies some extra PCIe lanes to run in x16/x16 or x16/x8/x8 mode, it makes me wonder if the price of the Hydra chip is cheaper than SLI certification and the NF200.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the software needs both a driver update as well as a longer list of working titles.&nbsp; However I fear that Lucid are more preoccupied with their Virtu technology on Z68, rather than Hydra.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIF2fpFonJyrXaWDeLSRmmSrnaaesrh5wGatoquZqXqjrcKkZK2nXaHCpLXDrGShsZSnrnCE</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
