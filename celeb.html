At age 5, Mase moved with his family to Harlem, New York City, but returned to Florida when he was a teen due to concerns he was running with the wrong crowds. However, Mase returned to NYC when he was 15, and enrolled in Manhattan Center High Schooll. Mase began performing as “Murder Mase” in 1993, along with the rap group, Children of the Corn. Mase enrolled in college at SUNY Purchase, but after meeting hip hop producer Country, who introduced him to <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Sean “Diddy” Combs</a></strong>, Mase decided to drop out and pursue a rap career. Mase was known for making appearances on numerous Bad Boy Records singles. Mase’s first solo EP, Harlem World, debuted at #1 on the Billboard Pop and R&B LP charts in 1997. He followed it with Double Up in 1999. However, during a May 1999 interview, Mase announced his retirement from music to pursue a calling from God. After a five year break, Mase returned to music in 2004, portraying a cleaner image to reflect his spiritual side. During the mid 2000s, Mase spent time touring and recording with <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>50 Cent</a></strong>’s G-Unit, but he was still under contract to Diddy’s Bad Boy Records. Diddy offered Mase a one-year release from Bad Boy, and in 2010, Mase decided to retire from rap again. The retirement didn’t last for long. In 2013, Mase announced that his upcoming album, released on his own label, would be called Now We Even. Mase and Diddy seemed to put the bad blood between them to a rest, as Mase appeared at the Bad Boy Reccords reunion at the 2015 BET Awards.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Mase is best known as an American rapper, best known for songs “Feel So Good, and “Lookin’ at Me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:</span><br>Mase is an ordained pastor.
