He was killed almost immediately, though the news didn't reach Mariya until nearly two years later. <a href=#>Driven by rage</a>, and with nothing left to lose, Mariya sold her house and belongings in exchange for a T-34, which she donated to the Soviet Union under the condition that she be the one to drive it.</p><p>The Defense Committee, realizing the publicity opportunities, agreed to the deal, and after a few months of training, Mariya and her "Fighting Girlfriend" joined the 26th Guards Tank Brigade as a driver and mechanic. Though her unit was initially skeptical of what they saw as nothing more than a publicity stunt, their opinions quickly changed after her first battle, in which she eliminated numerous machine gun nests, artillery guns, and the Nazis who manned them. When her tank was hit and immobilized by heavy enemy fire, she immediately jumped out to repair it. For this action, she was promoted to Sergeant, though "Goddess of Steel" might have been more apropos.</p><p>Unfortunately, after many battles and many dead Germans, her luck caught up with her in January 1944. She was killed during a battle near the village of Shvedy, while making yet more repairs to her immobilized tank. She did not, however, die before eliminating several machine gun nests, trenches, a self-propelled gun, and yet more Nazis for good measure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Bk3FocGeZo8CiusRmmJyso2K%2FpsLEp56eZZWrsrN7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
