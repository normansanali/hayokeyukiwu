Sofia shares her 32-year-old son, Manolo, with her former spouse, Joe Gonzalez. They were married from 1991 to 1993, before Sofia made her mark in Hollywood.</p><p>But the actress went through an even more recent divorce last year when Joe Manganiello filed to dissolve their marriage after they tied the knot eight years earlier. The divorce was settled quickly and the exes claimed in a statement it was amicable, though various reports have surfaced claiming that Joe changed his mind on watning kids, which Sofia was adamant about not wanting more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sofia-confirmed-she-didn-rsquo-t-want-babies-with-her-ex-husband>Sofia Confirmed She Didn’t Want Babies With Her Ex-Husband</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sofia-vergara-and-joe-manganiello.jpg><p>Sofia seemed to confirm the speculation last month while speaking to Spanish newspaper <a href=#>El País</a>, saying, “Well, I’m newly divorced from my second husband, who I was with for 10 years. My marriage broke up because my husband was younger. He wanted to have kids and I didn’t want to be an old mom.”</p><p>Despite the recent divorce, Sofia said she’s open to love again (though don’t expect her to have anymore kids). “So, if love comes along, he has to come with [his own] children,” the actress went on. “I’m almost in menopause, it’s the natural way of things. When my son becomes a dad, let him bring the baby to me for a while and then I’ll give it back to him and go on with my life. That’s what I have to do.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Joe and Sofia have been on other dates with people since their divorce news broke, with Sofia romancing a doctor at the beginning of the year, though it’s seemingly fizzled out. However, the actress is <a href=#>reportedly struggling to see Joe move on so quickly</a>, especially thinking of him having a baby with someone else.</p><p>“Joe’s not trying to rub it in Sofía’s face. But he does feel like enough time has passed,” <a href=#>a source told OK! Magazine</a>. “She’s clearly still upset. Especially now that Joe’s publicly showing off his new, younger girlfriend.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqqJ6Zlnq3sdGgmKuZXayyra%2FOppysZZ6axG6uwJuwZpmWqbKzecmonGalkaO0orrInqOlp12Ztre70ZycrGWWpL9uus6tZLCZnqm2r7OMpKCdq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
