Now the question arises: who should Usman fight next to reclaim his title and solidify his legacy in the division?</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The most obvious choice for Usman's next opponent is Leon Edwards himself. Edwards, who believes that a rematch is necessary to prove his victory was not a fluke, is eager to face Usman once again. Talks of a rematch between the two are already underway, with the possibility of UFC 278 featuring Usman vs. Edwards 2 being discussed. It would be a highly anticipated fight, as fans would witness a clash between two formidable fighters with a score to settle.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>However, there is another rising star in the welterweight division who could present a challenge to Usman Khamzat Chimaev. Chimaev has been making waves in the UFC with his dominant performances and has been vocal about his desire to fight Usman. Although Dana White initially dismissed the idea of a fight between them, Usman has lobbied for the matchup, indicating his willingness to take on this emerging threat. A fight between Usman and Chimaev would be intriguing, as it would test the champion's ability to handle an unpredictable and relentless opponent.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>If the UFC decides to go in a different direction, another potential opponent for Usman could be the winner of the Belal Muhammad vs. Sean Brady fight at UFC 281. Both Muhammad and Brady have been on impressive winning streaks and have established themselves as promising contenders in the division. A victory against either of them would further solidify Usman's claim for a title shot and provide an opportunity for him to showcase his skills against fresh competition.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Furthermore, there is another fighter in the middleweight division who could potentially move up to challenge Usman: Paulo Costa. Costa recently defeated Luke Rockhold and is now looking for his next move. One suggested matchup for Costa is against Jared Cannonier, a formidable middleweight contender. A fight between Usman and Costa would not only be an intriguing clash of styles but also a chance for Usman to prove himself against a larger opponent and potentially open up new opportunities for him in different weight classes.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>there are several viable options for Kamaru Usman's next fight. A rematch with Leon Edwards seems to be the most logical choice, as it would settle the score and determine the true champion of the welterweight division. However, the emergence of Khamzat Chimaev and the potential matchups with Belal Muhammad or Sean Brady also present exciting possibilities. Additionally, the idea of Usman moving up to face Paulo Costa or other middleweight contenders adds an element of intrigue to his journey. Ultimately, the decision rests with the UFC and the fans who eagerly await the announcement of Usman's next opponent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn6hlo528trjDZqKapZGnwm7B0qaYp2WWnrSpwIynnLGs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
