After Kimmel joked Shelton would have struggled to find a spare finger on the accessory heavy star's hand, Stefani glanced at her left hand and realized she'd forgotten to slide the sentimental jewelry back on after cleaning it.</p><p>"I forgot to wear my ring. It's like the first time! I thought, 'Okay, I'm going to put it in the jewelry cleaner so Jimmy sees how sparkly and amazing my ring is and then, hello empty finger!" she said. The mom of three admitted she was "so embarrassed" she'd forgotten to put it on and apologized to her husband, who she adorably referred to as "Blakey." Stefani then made it extra clear there's absolutely no drama here, adding, "I love my husband, and I love being married to him. It's just the greatest thing that's ever happened to me."</p><p>It's not too surprising Stefani wants to keep her rings clean, though, because we know her engagement ring in particular is super pricey. And we really mean super pricey, as&nbsp;<a href=#>Hello!</a> reported her engagement ring alone could be worth around $500,000! The star clearly loves the jewelry too (who wouldn't?) and has proudly showed it off multiple times, including on <a href=#>"Home & Family"</a> in December 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWlgaoZ4e9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2cxKa6jKyrnp6Ro7Zuw8CsZKOto6l6tLzOrauenF2strW0zq6rZqCVp3q4scOdoKefXae2r7OO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
