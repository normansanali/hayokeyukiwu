As such, they are the most prominent representation of <a href=# title="Team Rocket">Team Rocket</a> as a whole in the anime. Prior to <i><a href=# title=BW016>Rematch at the Nacrene Gym!</a></i>, the <a href=# title=EP001>very first episode</a> was the only single regular episode (excluding the clip show <a href=# title=AG120>AG120</a>) in which Team Rocket was completely absent.</p><p>In most of their appearances, they attempt to capture <a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a>'s <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a>, or any other Pokémon to give to Team Rocket's boss, <a href=# title="Giovanni (anime)">Giovanni</a>. However, they usually get defeated and are <a href=# title="Team Rocket mottos">blasted off</a> with their iconic catchphrase, "Looks like Team Rocket's blasting off again!", or variants such as "Team Rocket's blasting off again!" or "We're blasting off again!" In <i><a href=# title="Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon">Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon</a></i>, a <a href=# title="Bewear (anime)">Bewear</a> whisks them away as they say their catchphrase "We're off with a new blast!", either following a defeat or when Bewear interrupts a battle. Typically, right after making a capture, they will recite their <a href=# title="Team Rocket mottos">motto</a>, although on some rare occasions, they are unable to finish. This has been parodied by protagonists and even other Team Rocket members, such as <a href=# title=Butch>Butch</a> and <a href=# title=Cassidy>Cassidy</a>.</p><p>Since witnessing his power, the trio has been obsessed with capturing Ash's Pikachu, relentlessly pursuing Ash and <a href=# title="Ash's friends">his many friends</a> across the various regions of the <a href=# title="Pokémon world">Pokémon world</a> to do so. Although they often succeed in capturing Pikachu, they have never managed to hold on to him for longer than a day. They frequently develop or purchase various kinds of shockproof gadgets and machinery (<a href=# title="Team Rocket's mechas">mechas</a>, rubber suits, etc.) to aid in his capture, but these gadgets are often circumvented by non-Electric attacks and abilities (for which the trio constantly forgets to account) or simply backfire.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/9/9d/Looker_and_Team_Rocket.png/375px-Looker_and_Team_Rocket.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Team Rocket and Looker<p>Even though they usually only cause trouble for the main characters, they have sometimes helped them. When they have a common enemy, they will often ally with Ash and his friends, as shown in <i><a href=# title=M02>The Power of One</a></i> and later against <a href=# title="Team Aqua">Team Aqua</a> and <a href=# title="Team Magma">Team Magma</a>. They also played a key part in the fight against <a href=# title="Team Galactic">Team Galactic</a>, teaming up with <a href=# title=Looker>Looker</a>. They occasionally put their differences aside for personal reasons, only to later return to their thieving ways. One of the more common moments of truce is during <a href=# title="Pokémon Contest">Pokémon Contests</a>, which Jessie had a fondness for participating in under various aliases. In <i><a href=# title=JN143>Ride, Lapras, Ride!</a></i>, they helped Ash to remove a <a href=# class=mw-redirect title=Wailord>Wailord</a> that was stuck, albeit because Pikachu forced them to.</p><p>On several occasions, Jessie, James, and Meowth have shown that they are not all evil and have even displayed a degree of affection for Ash and his friends. For instance, the trio heroically sacrificed themselves to what they thought was certain death in <i><a href=# title=M02>The Power of One</a></i> in order to allow Ash's escape on Lugia, and also saved him from a fall in the next movie, <i><a href=# title=M03>Spell of the Unown: Entei</a></i>. Their justification was that in the case of the world being destroyed or Ash's death, they would be <a href=# title="Breaking the fourth wall">out of show business</a>, but it is implied that this is just bluster to cover the fact that they are not truly bad people.</p><p>The trio has also taken pity on the protagonists' struggles at various points in the series, sometimes going as far as to devise schemes just to help the heroes overcome their issues. One such example occurs in <i><a href=# title=EP134>Charizard's Burning Ambitions</a></i>, where Team Rocket kept <a href=# title="Ash's Charizard">Ash's Charizard</a> awake as it lay in the lake, and then built a huge mecha and attacked the <a href=# title="Charicific Valley">Charicific Valley</a> for the sole purpose of allowing Charizard to defeat them and gain acceptance in the valley. In <i><a href=# title=SM049>Mission: Total Recall!</a></i>, when <a href=# title=Faba>Faba</a> asked them to help him drain memories from <a href=# title="Lillie (anime)">Lillie</a>, they blatantly refused, citing their belief that all memories, good or bad, should be preserved at any cost. They, or more specifically Meowth, made a similar rationale for telling Mewtwo not to go through with erasing their memories in <i><a href=# title="Mewtwo Returns">Mewtwo Returns</a></i>, and implied part of the reason he was against it was because the clones themselves would have been negatively affected by lack of answers to their past. They had a particular fondness for <a href=# title="Ash's Infernape">Ash's Infernape</a> throughout <i><a href=# title="Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl">Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl</a></i>, frequently rooting for and encouraging him after witnessing his abusive treatment under <a href=# title=Paul>Paul</a> as a <a href=# title="Chimchar (Pokémon)">Chimchar</a>.</p><p>They rarely refer to Giovanni by name, usually just calling him "the boss". They also rarely call Ash or his friends by their names, instead preferring to refer to them as "the <a href=# title=Twerp>twerps</a>" or some variation thereof, to the point of occasionally almost ruining a disguise by calling them such.</p><p>The Team Rocket trio generally have a poor battling record, getting defeated by Ash and his friends in almost every encounter. This poor battling record has occurred often enough that it even was mentioned by some of the characters, with Misty also <a href=# title=EP056>implying</a> <a href=# title=EP134>twice</a> that beating Team Rocket in matches was not something worth bragging about regarding skill.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Artwork>Artwork</span></h4><h3><span id=I_Choose_You.21.2C_The_Power_of_Us.2C_Secrets_of_the_Jungle.2C_and_Distant_Blue_Sky.21></span><span class=mw-headline id=I_Choose_You!,_The_Power_of_Us,_Secrets_of_the_Jungle,_and_Distant_Blue_Sky!>I Choose You!, The Power of Us, Secrets of the Jungle, and Distant Blue Sky!</span></h3><table align=center><tbody readability=2><tr readability=4><td width=50px align=center><a href=# class=image><img alt=050Diglett.png src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/a6/0050Diglett.png/75px-0050Diglett.png decoding=async width=50 height=50 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td><td><b>This section is incomplete.</b><br>Please feel free to edit this section to add missing information and complete it.<br>Reason: Expansion of role in M23, and JNS05</td></tr></tbody></table><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/f/fe/Team_Rocket_trio_M20.png/375px-Team_Rocket_trio_M20.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>The Team Rocket trio appeared in <i><a href=# title=M20>I Choose You!</a></i>, which is set in a different continuity from the main series.

They are next encountered in Lavender Town, where they are implied to have killed Cubone's mother. The player then witnesses them kidnapping the orphan Cubone and taking it back to Celadon City. The player then encounters them in the Game Corner, where they accidentally mention the poster that conceals the switch to access the Team Rocket Hideout. The player later battles them in the hideout, just as they did in Yellow. After returning to Lavender Town and rescuing Mr. Fuji, the player has to battle them again like they did in Yellow.</p><p>The trio makes their next appearance outside of Fuchsia City, expressing their frustration with the slight complexity of the <a href=# title="GO Park">GO Park</a>. They then give the player the safari warden's false teeth before leaving. The player next encounters them in Saffron City, where a Rocket Grunt tries to keep them out of Silph Co., causing them to force their way in. The player must later battle them inside the Silph Co. like in Yellow.</p><p>They make one more appearance on Route 17 after the player enters the Hall of Fame. They lament the disappearance of Giovanni, then challenge the player to a battle after noticing them. After the player wins, the trio will ask if they would like to join Team Rocket. Regardless of what the player responds, they will give the player the "Blast-off set" of clothing, which differs slightly depending on the player's gender to resemble either Jessie's uniform and hair or James's.
