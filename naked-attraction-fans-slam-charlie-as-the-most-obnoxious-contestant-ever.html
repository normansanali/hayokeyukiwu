Since it launched back in 2016, Naked Attraction has been shocking viewers with its approach to dating. Rather than go down the personality and ‘connection’ route, the Channel 4 show gets to the nitty-gritty and allows daters to pick their ideal match, based on pure physical attraction.
The new series kicked off on Thursday, January 10th and saw previous contestant Emmy-Lou return to the show hoping third time’s the charm."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Although we did some digging into Charlie, we could not find much about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>Naked Attraction</span></a> star. However, as Charlie stated he loved living in Bournemouth, it’s most likely he is a student at Bournemouth University.</p><p>Charlie expressed that he had been going for personality when looking for a partner and it had not been a success. So, in a 180-turn, Charlie decided to base his date purely on her physical attributes.</p><p><i>And Charlie was not&nbsp;afraid to bring out his scientific side when it came to analysing the girls.</i></p><p>He had been single for around a year before entering the dating show.</p><ul><li><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FAKE ATTRACTION</a>:</strong> Has Anna Richardson had plastic surgery? Botox to lipo!</li></ul><h3>Charlie on Naked Attraction</h3><p>Throughout his time on Naked Attraction, Charlie continuously boasted about his experience in the bedroom, claiming he was a BDSM “master” and getting into the specifics about what he was physically attracted to.</p><p>This did not go down well with the viewers at home and the female participants on the show who called him “rude” and “obnoxious” on Twitter.</p><p>A particularly eye-watering moment was when Charlie began to describe one of his prospective dates’ as “looser” and stated that one of the females boobs were “too big” but that he wouldn’t mind them for one specific sexual act. Charlie’s definitely not going to live this down for a while…</p><ul><li><b><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LOVE ISLAND LEAK</a>:</b> Connor Durman’s ‘ex-girlfriend’ says he broke up with her for the show</li></ul><p>https://twitter.com/AIM_Bandito/status/1215406629488861185</p><h3>Charlie’s Inbetweeners doppelgänger</h3><p>Although Charlie claimed his doppelgänger was Peter Crouch – and even performed ‘the robot’ to show off their similarities – that was not who viewers at home thought he resembled.</p><p>Instead, Naked Attraction fans thought Charlie was more Jay Cartwright from The Inbetweeners.</p><p>The character (played by James Buckley) is famous for being braggadocious about his sexual activity, despite the fact Jay is a virgin and totally inexperienced in the bedroom.</p><p>There were numerous viewers who took to Twitter to share the similarities. One Tweeted: “Getting a strong Jay from Inbetweeners vibe from this guy.” Another asked: “<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Is Jay from Inbetweeners on tonight’s </span><span class=r-18u37iz>#nakedattraction</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">?”</span></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I just remembered who Charlie reminds me of…Uncanny!! <a href=#>#nakedattraction</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kEUYKzgLlG</a></p><p>— Bob Ohn (@RichardHK83) <a href=#>January 9, 2020</a></p></figure>View Tweet<p style=text-align:center>WATCH NAKED ATTRACTION SERIES 6 THURSDAYS AT 10 PM ON CHANNEL 4</p><p style=text-align:center><strong><img decoding=async draggable=false src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/svg/1f4f8.svg alt=? style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON&nbsp;</strong><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">INSTAGRAM </a></span><strong>AND&nbsp;</strong><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FACEBOOK</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfmLWius2eo2ZsX6OurLHDZpitrKKWsLW1zqdkn5meqHq0uMCmZJygkae5qrGMmqpmrJiaeq670q1kqJqepMWqu9SsZJynnqmytMDAp6tmnaaavw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
