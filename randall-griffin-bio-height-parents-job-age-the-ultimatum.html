However, given the confidentiality agreement, it’s hard to say if the two broke up or continued their relationship after the show.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Looking back, Randall and Shanique joined </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> after cherishing a one-and-a-half year of a relationship. As the theme of the series was for the couples to switch partners with the other participants for a trial marriage. It was Shanique who issued “the ultimatum” to Randall. Meaning — Shanique was ready to get married.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Unfortunately, Randall wasn’t ready just yet as he explained he had to some debts before settling down for good — a cliché used by almost everyone to use as an excuse to gain more time.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Thus, Randall then went on to pick Madlyn Ballatori for the “trial marriage,” while Shanique chose Zay Wilson.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Initially, Shanique was adamant that she wouldn’t even share bedsheets with Zay. But, once she heard how Randall on the other side was giving Madlyn the attention and affection she had always craved, she switched gears.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Having had enough, Shanique then confronted Randall and went as far as to even tell him that she just wanted him to “just sit in a f**king corner and miss” her. While their argument ended with Shanique walking away, it only made Randall see things more clearly about his potential future with Madlyn.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, Shanique (devoted to only Randall) returned to him, which made things certainly a little awkward when they reunited.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>When everything was said and done, the couple did move in together for the experiment’s last stage. And besides still butting heads about Madlyn, the duo were during all right — communicating and expressing a lot more than before.</span></p><h3><b>Randall Griffin Parents</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Randall Griffin was born to parents </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Randall C</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Devlin Griffin</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>His father, Randall is a</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> Tuskegee Institute</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> graduate who went on to found</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> After Life Recording</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 1972.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for his mother, Devlin is a former Registered Nurse who worked at the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Santa Monica Hospital</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.
