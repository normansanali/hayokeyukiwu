People in Manhattan no longer have to trek to the Rockaways or Coney Island to dip their toes in the sand thanks to this week’s opening ofthe borough’s first beach, a welcoming sandy stretch at the Gansevoort Peninsula in Hudson River Park west of the Meatpacking District.
Bathing suits and bare chests were on full display Tuesday at the new beach, which was designed by the same firm behind Manhattan’s now-famous High Line park and features 1,200 tons of sand, blue beach chairs with umbrellas, tables and benches by the water and open green, grassy park spaces."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They were seated right by the shore, just between the rocks and the sand, with a view of the New Jersey skyline.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is a gorgeous day, I had to dig out all of my summer clothes again because I put them all away two weeks ago when it was 15 degrees out,” Seikaly said.&nbsp;“It’s amazing, we’re very much enjoying the beach.</p><p>“We had a business lunch at 1:30, and he called me and said, ‘OK, the beach opened, so we should meet there at 12,’ and so here we are,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>“I cannot get over this sand, I’m pouring it all over my body parts and I’m like … this beach is not going to stay clean for too long.”&nbsp;</p><p>Gallagher, a lawyer, added, “We’re having a business meeting right here — it’s the new office of Manhattan, everybody should be here.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">You can’t get views like this on the Jersey Shore. <span class=credit>NY Post</span></figure><p>“I used to go down to Pier 64, and this is much closer, much better, good scenery — I just hope it doesn’t get washed away,” he said.&nbsp;“This is the perfect place for law, small business and the beach.”</p><p>Taylor Yasui and Francis Wong were sunbathing in their swimsuits on a patch of grass, listening to music on a portable speaker.</p><p>“I saw a post on my city council representative’s Instagram that this beach just opened yesterday, and I was like — tomorrow’s going to be 80 degrees, we have to come here, whatever work I have can wait but this cannot,” Yasui said.&nbsp;</p><p>Wong said, “You have to make the most of the sun when it’s out, especially in New York.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Bathing suits and bare chests were on full display Tuesday at the new beach, which was designed by the same firm behind Manhattan’s now-famous High Line park. <span class=credit>Gabriella Bass</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Adirondack chairs provide breathtaking city views. <span class=credit>Hudson River Park</span></figure><p>Swimming in the Hudson River was off limits, and Park Enforcement officers from the Parks Department were on hand to make sure everyone complied.
