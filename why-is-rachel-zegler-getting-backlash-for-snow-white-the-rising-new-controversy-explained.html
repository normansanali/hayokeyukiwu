The rising new controversy, explained</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-07-30</div><p data-characters=491 data-injectable=true data-video=true>Disney has been getting considerable flak for trying to mold its beloved animated classics to modern times and make them more inclusive while lessening or outright scrapping the presence of any dated concept in the new live-action adaptations. As this particular mission has been achieving mixed reviews so far, the upcoming live-action <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Snow White</strong></a> getting similar treatment upon its release in 2024 was imminent. But the film‚Äôs titular star has already kickstarted a storm, all by herself.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=112 data-current-count=112 data-injectable=false>Just to be clear, it wasn‚Äôt like Snow White was smoothly sailing or getting undivided love up until now.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=473 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>Apart from the justified ire from folks who don‚Äôt want Disney to muck up another classic with poor storytelling skills, the flick has also been attracting backlash for pointless reasons like the studio attempting to make cinema an inclusive and progressive space. So, just like Halle Bailey, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Rachel Zegler</strong></a> continues facing racist backlash over her casting, though the actress has poured cold water over her naysayers by wanting no part of the ‚Äú<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nonsensical discourse</a>.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>But trolls are trolls, strangely proud of their said status, and they wasted zero seconds in jumping on the chance to prove why Rachel Zegler as Snow White is a bad, bad choice.</p><h2 id=h-what-did-rachel-zegler-say-about-snow-white data-injectable=false>What did Rachel Zegler say about Snow White?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Rachel-Zegler-as-Anthea-in-Shazam-Fury-of-the-Gods.png><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>Well, 1937‚Äôs animated Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to be precise. The film is serving as the foundation for the upcoming live-action adaptation but only loosely influences where the story goes. If there were still any doubts about how accurate Disney plans to be while adapting the animation, they have been recently erased by Zegler‚Äôs fresh comments about the film‚Äôs script.</p><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no longer 1937,‚Äù Zegler shared with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs [Snow White] not going to be saved by the prince and she‚Äôs not going to be dreaming about true love.</p><p>‚ÄúShe‚Äôs dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be and the leader that her late father told her that she could be if she was fearless, fair, brave and true. So, it‚Äôs just a really incredible story for young people everywhere to see themselves in.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=735 data-injectable=true>Anyone hoping for the new Snow White to focus on the princess day-dreaming about true love and getting kissed awake ‚Äî without being able to give her consent ‚Äî out of her death-like slumber can say goodbye to the possibility as Zegler has pretty much confirmed that is not going to be the focus of the film. She has also called out Prince Charming‚Äôs behavior in the original film, labeling him a ‚Äústalker‚Äù for following Snow White around.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>So far, there is no prince in the film, though there is a new character named Jonathan (played by Andrew Burnap). But Zegler has warned that it would be foolhardy to just automatically presume this Snow White is going to be all focused on finding true love.</p><h2 id=h-so-what-is-the-new-snow-white-controversy-again data-injectable=false>So, what is the new Snow White controversy again?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Snow-White-and-the-Seven-Dwarfs-1.jpg><p data-characters=525 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true>Well, boy meets girl and they fall in love is always going to be the classic romantic angle in cinema. But what is the problem if we get rid of the problematic edges in its representation along the way? What if a woman (FYI, Snow White was 14, 14 in the OG film, just so you don‚Äôt forget) is not simply restricted to be the damsel in distress, not picking up after men, not razor-focused on just love because nothing else can be salvation in her head, or getting kissed by men who don‚Äôt know the concept of consent?&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=143 data-injectable=false>But evidently, it is a problem as social media has been overflowing with comments about how Disney has chosen a ‚ÄúPR disaster‚Äù for its film.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>It just gets worse and worse‚Ä¶.</p><p>The new Snow White says that the Prince was a creepy stalker and suggests that all scenes of the Prince could be cut</p><p>She‚Äôs a walking PR disaster for Disney <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7QJGDIx5er</a></p>‚Äî End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) <a href=#>August 13, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Disney is trying a really interesting marketing strategy where the star of the new Snow White spends a year before the movie‚Äôs release publicly talking about how much she despises Snow White</p><p><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/DlQCUqbqnQ</a></p>‚Äî Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) <a href=#>August 13, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true>Zegler‚Äôs comments that Snow White is not going to make finding a guy the princess‚Äô only route to happiness. She doesn‚Äôt necessarily say that there is not going to be a love story or for Snow White to be a bold, independent woman, true love is out of the question ‚Äî it is just not going to be the only thing the film is concerned about.</p><p data-characters=79 data-current-count=79 data-injectable=false>But given <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the explosive response to her comments</a>, she may as well have said it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Question for the new woke Snow White:</p><p>What‚Äôs so wrong with find your prince and falling in love?

Will it change how Disney makes the film? Hopefully not.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqcWMoqpmqpGYtaa4jLOcoKSVp3qosdOtoKefXZeupLfLmqqhZZakv26%2FzaiuZq%2BYnsGmedOhnGaqmai2r7OMp5ywZZOku7W%2Bzq%2Bcq6upYrK5vMuaoKedlGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
