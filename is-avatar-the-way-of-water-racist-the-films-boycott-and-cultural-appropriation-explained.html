He said,</p><p>“I felt like I was 130 years back in time watching what the Lakota Sioux might have been saying at a point when they were being pushed and they were being killed and they were being asked to displace and they were being given some form of compensation… This was a driving force for me in the writing of ‘Avatar’ — I couldn’t help but think that if they [the Lakota Sioux] had had a time-window and they could see the future … and they could see their kids committing suicide at the highest suicide rates in the nation … because they were hopeless and they were a dead-end society — which is what is happening now — they would have fought a lot harder.”</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>As Cameron’s past remarks began circulating online, other Native Americans and Indigenous Twitter users expressed their honest opinions and why they no longer support the&nbsp;Avatar&nbsp;franchise.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>One person stated, “Avatar&nbsp;is canceled” because of Cameron’s resurfaced comments and how wrong the 68-year-old was for saying that Lakota people should have fought harder.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Don't watch that movie.
