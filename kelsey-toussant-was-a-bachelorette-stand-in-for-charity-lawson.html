Life is different and it’s honestly wild.”</p><p class=p1>Kelsey then shared a photo from her time working for ABC, in which she stood next to host <strong>Jesse Palmer</strong> on the <i>Men Tell All </i>stage. Kelsey and Jesse, 45, pretended to engage in conversation while dressed in casual clothes.</p><p class=p1>According to her TikTok caption, Kelsey was tapped as <strong><a href=#>“Charity [Lawson]</a></strong>’s stand-in” during her season 20 in 2023. Fans first met Joey, now 28, on Charity’s season, where <a href=#>he ultimately finished as runner-up</a> behind her now-fiancé, <strong>Dotun Olubeko</strong>.</p><p class=p1>Joey was then cast as the next lead of <i>The Bachelor, </i>and Kelsey was enlisted as one of his contestants. Her official Bachelor Nation bio did not list her past with Charity and the show, only calling her an actress.</p><p class=p1>“Kelsey T. is the kind of woman who radiates joy and ambition everywhere she goes. She describes herself as understanding, adventurous, and ready to embark on the adventure of a lifetime with Joey,” her <a href=# rel=noopener>bio</a> reads. “Kelsey T. has had multiple long-term relationships and was engaged to her ex. She says she knows she is ‘ready to fall in love again’ and wants a man who will appreciate the thoughtfulness she brings to their relationship.”</p><a title=@kelseytoussant href=#>@kelseytoussant</a><p>What a full circle moment…it’s so surreal ✨ started off as Charity’s standin.
