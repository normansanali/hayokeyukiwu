Music would, it seems, be a huge part of his life from the off. More specifically, musical collaborations. According to the outlet, the young schoolboy Nash found a musical partner in Allan Clarke. By their teenage years, they were performing as Ricky and Dane Young. Further collaborations saw their numbers swell until Nash was an up-and-comer in a group that would become known as <a href=#>the Hollies</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>From there, tremendous success awaited. Per <a href=#>Britannica</a>, the 1968 creation of <a href=#>Crosby, Stills & Nash</a> brought together three of the biggest musical names of their era (David Crosby, Stephen Stills, and Nash himself), and were, for a time, also joined by Neil Young as Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. It was a lineup for the ages, and their releases were legendary. 1970's "Déjà Vu" was deemed by <a href=#>AllMusic's</a>&nbsp;Bruce Eder to have been "One of the most hotly awaited second albums in history," a chart-topping "product of four potent musical talents who were all ascending to the top of their game."</p><p dir=ltr>As a solo performer, per <a href=#>Nash's official website</a>, he found great success too. Beginning in earnest in 1971, he released several solo albums, and 1977 would see Crosby, Stills & Nash launch a reunion album. 2012 marked the band's most recent release, a compilation of some of their iconic live performances. Of late, however, Nash's more low-profile commitments and his personal struggles have seen him become rather quiet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kHBpcG5iZMSpxYyypq5lopa%2FprjYZp%2BemaJirqO71K1koKqRna6uec2aqqFlpJ2ytLGMnZiyq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
