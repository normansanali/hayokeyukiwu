Also, it might be easy to spot her in the crowd as she often dons dress pants and her signature crisp white shirt.</p><p>Not only that, but Mrs. DeVos thanks her family for where she is now. She comes from a family, who not only travels or indulges in arts but also works together. All in all, Dan DeVos’ wife must be earning significantly, given that she has received significantly immense positive responses.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Grew_Up_With_Two_Siblings></span>Grew Up With Two Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pamella DeVos was born<strong> Pamella VanderLaan</strong> to <strong>Charlotte Ann Vanderlaan</strong> and <strong>Dick Vanderlaan</strong> in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Her parents raised her along with her sisters, <strong>Sheryl DeSanto</strong> and <strong>Brenda Thompson</strong>.
