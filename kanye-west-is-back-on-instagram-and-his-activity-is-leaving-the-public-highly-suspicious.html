After a series of antisemitic and lavishly insensitive comments both <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">praising Hitler</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">insulting Jewish people</a>, not to mention posting a photo of a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">swastika inside a Star of David</a>, Ye was suspended from both Instagram and Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>What his return means for the public is that all eyes are trained on his online activity, as one truly can never predict what may come out of the former billionaire’s mouth.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>One Reddit user noted that Ye deleted all of his Instagram reels since his return. Understandably, the comment section of this post is filled with ideations about what exactly this might mean. Some predict it’ll involve music, others are convinced it’ll be about the 2024 election.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=591 data-injectable=true><a href=#>ye just deleted all of his old reels</a> from <a href=#>GoodAssSub</a></figure><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=248 data-injectable=false>Among the supposed thousands of accounts Ye unfollowed is the @kanyedefenseteam account, whose sole purpose is as the name implies – to defend Ye against any and all hate thrown his way, even the kind stemming from his antisemitic opinions.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Ye unfollowed Kanyedefenseteam</a> from <a href=#>GoodAssSub</a></figure><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>That’s not all. Ye also unfollowed Drake and Candace Owens, the latter of which he held in such high regard that she was even considered as his Vice Presidential running mate on his 2024 presidential campaign, according to <a href=#>Newsweek</a>. Ye has made it clear he intends to run for office in 2024, but if that pans out, we’re not likely to see Owens by his side.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=664 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Kanye insta</a> from <a href=#>GoodAssSub</a></figure><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>On Reddit, one user pointed out that Ye’s follower count dropped from 7.3k to 6.1k since his return. However, as of this writing, We Got This Covered can confirm that Ye still has 7.3 followers, implying he either followed thousands of new accounts, or the same ones he briefly unfollowed. Except for Drake and Candance Owens, of course.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Ye ig followings went from 7,3k to 6,1k</a> from <a href=#>GoodAssSub</a></figure><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>Perhaps one of the more baffling and disturbing aspects of this whole scenario is who Ye has chosen to follow on his Instagram. A vast majority of accounts appear to be regular, ordinary people who are neither famous nor have more than a handful of followers themselves. Some don’t even have posts or profile pictures. It begs the question why? Many of these followers, such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@jamesssxu</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@t_tonia1</a> were baffled themselves to discover that Ye was following them. These follows took place over the course of 2021 and 2022, not 2023.</p><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>This is not the first time Ye has returned to Instagram after being locked out, and it’s safe to say the public is waiting for him to be locked out once again. Unfortunately for Ye, that usually entails more antisemitic rants.&nbsp;The public may hope he just lies low and fads into memory, but knowing Ye that’s unlikely to happen.</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=713 data-injectable=false>According to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Anti-Defamation League</a>, antisemitic incidents reached an “all-time high” in 2021, and 2022 is on a similar track. This includes assault, harassment, and vandalism.
