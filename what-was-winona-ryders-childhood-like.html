She used her talents and experiences to become one of the most famous actresses ever.</p><p>She did have an unconventional childhood, though, and has dubbed herself an outsider. Actually, she had a childhood closer to actor&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joaquin Phoenix and his siblings</a>. She was born to hippie-like parents, who moved the family to a commune-like place to live.</p><p>Here's what Ryder's childhood was really like.</p><h2 id=she-was-named-after-the-city-she-was-born-in>She Was Named After The City She Was Born In</h2><p>Ryder was&nbsp;named after&nbsp;the town she was born in; Winona, Minnesota. Her middle name is Laura, after Laura Huxley, author Aldous Huxley's wife, and Ryder's parents' friend.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She&nbsp;was, what some call, a "shoelace baby,"</a> or a baby not born near a hospital, who needs boiled shoelaces to help tie off the umbilical cord.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Forgot About The Incident That Almost Ruined Winona Ryder's Career</a></span></p><p>"I basically came a little early," Ryder told Parade, "and it was on a farm in Winona, and my dad went into a complete panic, and all he knew was to sterilize a shoelace!"</p><p>Her parents are Cynthia Palmer and Michael D. Horowitz, who are creative people in their own right. Her mother is an author, video producer, and editor, and her father is an author, editor, publisher, and antiquarian bookseller. Her father was also an archivist for the psychedelic guru Timothy Leary,&nbsp;who became&nbsp;Ryder's godfather.</p><p>Her father's family&nbsp;is Jewish and was originally called Tomchin. They fled Europe but most of them were killed in the Holocaust. When they came to America they changed their name to Horowitz. In fact, Ryder had a fear as a child that someone would come and drag the family away because of what her family went through in the Holocaust.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Ryder was only six months old, her family moved to San Fransico.</p><h2 id=her-parents-were-free-spirited>Her Parents Were Free-Spirited</h2><p>Ryder wouldn't label her parents&nbsp;as hippies. "They were much more—I would say—beatnik, even though beatnik is sort of the precursor to the hippies."</p><p>So her parents were pretty much hippies before it was cool, and hung out with family friends like Leary, and&nbsp;the Beat Movement poets Allen Ginsberg,&nbsp;Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and science-fiction&nbsp;writer&nbsp;Philip K. Dick.</p><p>Her mother once worked as a projectionist at the University of Minnesota, so she was skilled in setting up a sheet and a projector for her daughter to watch films against the barn. "I remember watching To Kill a Mockingbird. That was when I really fell in love with movies," she said.</p><p>When she was seven, her family moved onto a piece of land in Northern California, called Rainbow, which was owned by one of her father's friends, and housed six other families. Ryder doesn't like to use the word commune, though, when describing it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Look At Winona Ryder And Rob Lowe's Rumored Relationship</a></span></p><p>"The place we lived was, like, 380 acres of redwoods. It was beautiful." There was no electricity&nbsp;and therefore no television, so Ryder became an avid reader. Her favorite was J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye.</p><p>"We didn’t have a lot of money," Ryder told Marie Claire. "But the love compensation was amazing. My dad would make little things exciting, like bringing home Rolos. There’s that saying, 'you find your family,' but I would have chosen them even if they weren’t my parents. They’re my best friends."</p><p>She says they are still madly in love with each other.</p><h2 id=kids-at-school-bullied-her>Kids At School Bullied Her</h2><p>At age 10, her family moved to Petaluma, California, and she attended Kenilworth Junior High, where she was bullied. "I definitely had a difficult time—like, socially." Her grades were good but she was definitely an outsider.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ryder told&nbsp;Harper’s Bazaar&nbsp;in 2000, an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">especially horrific yet&nbsp;justifiably revengeful story</a> about her bullying days. In fact, it was&nbsp;a story that went viral.</p><p>"I was wearing an old Salvation Army–shop boy’s suit. I had a hall pass, so I went to the [girls’] bathroom," she said. "I heard people saying, 'Hey, faggot.' They slammed my head into a locker. I fell to the ground and they started to kick the shit out of me. I had to have stitches. The school kicked me out, not the bullies. Years later, I went to a coffee shop in Petaluma, and I ran into one of the girls who’d kicked me, and she said, 'Winona, Winona, can I have your autograph?' and I said, 'Do you remember me? I went to Kenilworth. Remember how, in seventh grade, you beat up that kid?' and she said, 'Kind of,' and I said, 'That was me. Go f— yourself!'"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Winona Ryder Was Cast As Joyce Byers On 'Stranger Things'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other bullies used to throw Cheetos at her because she had a crew cut and liked the Sex Pistols.</p><p>Despite all this, she started her acting career shortly after moving to Petaluma. Her parents were strict about it though and demanded that she maintain a 4.0-grade point average and work on the weekends. At&nbsp;13 she got a role in Lucas, but acting made the bullying, which carried on into high school, worse.</p><p>"I remember thinking, 'Ooh, it’s like the number-one movie. This is going to make things great at school.' But it made things worse. They called me a witch."</p><p>She did end up graduating high school with a 4.0, and working with great people in the industry, at such a young age, gave her some impressive role models and life-long friends, like Tim Burton, Keanu Reeves, and Johnny Depp.</p><p>She's still just as grounded as ever, and her parents continue to be her biggest influences. We wonder what her bullies are doing today. Not starring on Stranger Things, that's for sure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Winona Ryder Might Be Keanu Reeves' Biggest Fan</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsSiv4ywoKennpZ6s8XDnqmsZZOdtq2wx6imnWWcnrimew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
