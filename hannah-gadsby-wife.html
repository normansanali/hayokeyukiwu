But after hearing Hannah spill their pain to us in the most eloquent and hysterical way possible, we're just glad that they've found happiness. They secretly got married back in January 2021.

"I would like to introduce all y’all to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenney Shamash</a>. She is a producer extraordinaire. She is very funny and is really talented at reciting facts. It is a joy to behold," Hannah wrote in an April 2021 Instagram post, which featured the married duo happily chowing down on ice cream cones.</p><p>"We got married in January and we are very chuffed about it. For the record: This is me gushing. I am full of very positive feelings. This is a nice story. My heartfelt thanks to everybody who voted for marriage equality. #married #really? #yeahtotally," the post continued.</p><p>Marriage equality in Australia passed in late 2017, two years behind the U.S. Their wife, Jenney Shamash — who's worked as a producer in both London and New York — produced Hannah's 2020 sophomore Netflix special, Douglas, which earned Jenney an Emmy nomination.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Dr. Hannah Gadsby (@hannah_gadsby)</a></p></figure><p>It was in Douglas that the world-famous Hannah revealed their autism diagnosis to the world.
