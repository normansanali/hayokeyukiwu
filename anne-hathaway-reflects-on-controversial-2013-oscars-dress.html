The actress, 35, shared a photo of her classic look from the 2013 Academy Awards, when she took home the award for best supporting actress for her role in Les Miserables.</p><p>“I had to change my dress last minute and so it looked like my nipples were hard, I had full blown laryngitis and had to sing, and a bunch of corny haters were getting lots of attention from the media for being haters but you know what? It was still the best,” the Oceans 8 star captioned the photo on Sunday, March 4. “To all the nominees, <a href=#>I hope you have a BLAST tonight</a> doing all that #bestlife #oscars stuff. Peace xx.”</p><p>As previously reported, Hathaway changed her dress at the last moment after learning during rehearsals that her Les Misérables costar <a href=#><strong>Amanda Seyfried</strong></a> was wearing an Alexander McQueen similar to the Valentino gown she planned on wearing. “Anne was like ‘WTF?!’ <a href=#>She started throwing a fit</a>,” an insider told Us Weekly at the time. She “never told Amanda she had to change the dress,” but Seyfried was still flustered by Hathaway’s reaction. “Amanda didn’t want to deal with it and left” the rehearsal, the source added.</p><p>The night before the show, she received the pink satin Prada gown she wore to the show. She received a great amount of backlash about the dress and told <a href=#>Harper’s Bazaar about it in 2014</a>: “I look in the mirror, turn to [husband] Adam [Schulman], and say, ‘It looks like my nipples are hard.’ He says, ‘You look beautiful. Your nipples look pointy. The red carpet’s about to close. We gotta go,’” she said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The actress also received criticism for her acceptance speech. When she won, she said “It came true!” – a statement that people didn’t like. In an interview <a href=#>with The Guardian two years later</a>, she revealed she wasn’t happy at all when she won.</p><p>“I felt very uncomfortable,” she said in October 2016. “I kind of lost my mind doing that movie, and it hadn’t come back yet. Then I had to stand up in front of people and feel something I don’t feel which is uncomplicated happiness. It’s an obvious thing, you win an Oscar and you’re supposed to be happy. I didn’t feel that way … I tried to pretend that I was happy and I got called out on it, big time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJinppVitaLAx5qumrFdp7KnuMScq6xln6N6pLvNramorpWnwKqty2ZpaWljYry0r8CrqmacoprAtHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
