But viewers at home were worried that the pop star had pushed things too far herself, sporting a face clearly filled to the brim with physical enhancements.</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>Comments started rolling in from devoted fans to malicious news anchors attacking the way the pop icon looked.

The most she’s ever said came from a 2012 interview in which she said, “’I am certainly not against plastic surgery. However, I am absolutely against having to discuss it.’</p><p data-characters=653 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>When comparing the two photos above — the left is from 2008 and the right from the 2023 Grammy Awards — it’s clear Madonna has had a facelift or two, some eyebrow lifts, lip injections, fillers, probably some buccal fat removal, maybe some collagen implants, and potentially much more. None of this can be confirmed by anyone other than Madonna or her doctor, but most of these “noticeable” alterations began to really take shape right around the time the pop singer encroached on her 60s. Skin can only stay soft and supple for so long, and the 60s are a notorious point in a person’s lifespan when the skin begins to wrinkle and sag.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>At the end of the day, Madonna’s body is hers and hers alone and she can do whatever she wants to it. The idea that the public has autonomy over a celebrity’s life is a misconstrued phenomenon as old as fame itself. The truth of the matter is no one can or should have the right to tell Madonna – or any celebrity – how to live their life, and that includes any and all decisions to enhance their physical appearance, no matter what we may think of it.</p><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=204 data-injectable=false>Some faces take better to plastic surgery than others, that’s all – just as some bodies take better to physical exercise. That shouldn’t mean we cherry-pick who to praise and who to tear down.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=true>One thing we know for sure is that even though the conversation surrounding Madonna’s physical appearance may be riddled with hate, concern, contempt, disgust, praise, applause, and every other emotion under the rainbow, one thing is certain: she couldn’t care less what anyone has to say. She’s too busy living her life, as she should be.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>Speaking of which, Madonna will be hitting the road between July and Dec of this year for her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">40th-anniversary “Celebration Tour.”</a> Here’s to seeing Madonna’s face live, any version of it we’re lucky enough to see.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZpuinF2irqW7zaeYZpyfYsGweceeqWaekZiybrTEq2SbnZakv6Z5wKebZpmWqbKzec%2Bhpq2nXZrFsbjAoqWenF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
