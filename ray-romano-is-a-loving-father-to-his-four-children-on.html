He acknowledged the love and support of his family for his job, especially the delight of his children in hearing him voice an Ice Age character.</p><p>Back in the day, Ray would create fictionalized accounts of his family’s real-life events for his films and TV shows. In addition, he used his juniors as extras in a number of his projects. Even now, he and his family are happy to share a home, but they choose to stay out of the public eye.</p><p>According to reports, Ray spent the turbulent pandemic period with his wife and children who are now adults. In a 2020 interview with People, the actor discussed the benefits and drawbacks of staying at home with his family during a pandemic.</p><p>However, he didn’t mind visiting his wife and kids at their home and loving on them.</p><p>“We already have the 22-year-old here. We also have twins who reside a short distance away in their apartment. So they came back. Additionally, my daughter owns a house in Venice, California. She’ll stay here for a week before going back home.</p><p>It’s rather enjoyable. They are adults nonetheless.

His twin brothers Gregory and Matthew also work in the industry. Gregory reportedly served as a production assistant on The Late Show With James Corden, according to Closer Weekly.
