I would have been really surprised,” the <a href=#>Overserved With Lisa Vanderpump</a> star, 62, told Us Weekly exclusively on Monday, March 15, hinting that the couple didn’t leave on their own. “Who makes the rules? It’s not me. … Bravo, they produce the show. Even though I’m an executive producer on it, you know, they <a href=#>make most of the decisions</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lisa-Vanderpump-Still-Hasnt-Heard-From-Stassi-Schroeder-Hints-Jax-Taylor-and-Brittany-Cartwright-Didnt-Leave.jpg><p>In December, the pair announced in matching statements via Instagram <a href=#>that they wouldn’t be returning</a> to the Bravo reality show. After getting called out for their exact same wording, Cartwright, 32, replied, “Do you guys really truly think<a href=#> we got to write whatever we wanted</a>?”</p><p>The pair, who married in 2019, are currently expecting their first child and listed that as the main reason for their exit. “I am 41 with a baby on the way,” Taylor wrote. “[This] was the best choice for my whole family.”</p><p>The Pooch Perfect judge, for her part, also revealed that she <a href=#>has not heard</a>&nbsp;from Schroeder, 32, who was one of the four stars let go from the show last summer.</p><p>“I <a href=#>haven’t spoken to her</a>. I did reach out to her a couple of times, but she never responded after she was let go,” the <a href=#>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> alum told Us. “And that’s her choice, you know. That’s OK.”</p><p>Schroeder, who <a href=#>welcomed a daughter</a> with husband <a href=#><strong>Beau Clark</strong></a> in January, <a href=#>opened up about the difficult time</a> she went through after <a href=#>being cut from the reality show</a>, noting that being pregnant made it better.</p><p>“If I wasn’t pregnant, I probably would have just like … gone to alcoholism, Xanax,” she said on her “The Good, The Bad, The Baby” podcast earlier this month. “I would have lashed out, dark passenger-ed. And I think our <a href=#>baby 100 percent saved me</a>.”</p><p>For more from Vanderpump, watch the exclusive video above</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Overserved premieres on E!
