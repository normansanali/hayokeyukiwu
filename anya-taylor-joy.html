It became the most-watched scripted series by Netflix in 2020. In reaction to the news, Taylor-Joy said-<br><p>I get overwhelmed quite easily.

When things become this successful, it’s not about you any more – it belongs to everybody. I prefer that, I think.”</p></li></ul><ul><li>Anya had to read the novel ‘The Queen’s Gambit’ by novelist Walter Tevis to understand and prepare herself for the character.

She also uses cruelty-free beauty products as she believes in making environmentally conscious choices as a consumer. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_4><a href=#>[4]</a></span></li></ul><ul><li>When Anya decided to drop out of her school, she wrote a note informing her parents of her decision, and her parents were thrilled with her decision. During an interview, Anya told about this incident and said-<br><p>My youngest older sister is seven years older than me so I said to them, ‘look, I’m your youngest child, I’ve dropped out of school and you have no obligation to be here anymore. Go out and travel the world! Enjoy yourselves and spend time together.’ I stayed at home in South West London with my sister – and my parents are still traveling to this day.”</p></li></ul><ul><li>In 2020, Anya Taylor-Joy became a part of English director Edgar Wright’s upcoming psychological horror film ‘Last Night in Soho.’ In October 2020, she became a part of the cast for Furiosa, a spin-off of Mad Max: Fury Road.
