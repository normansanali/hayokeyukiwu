In hip-hop, that energy has so far manifested in multiple chains of interlocking beefs — some hinging on the serious allegations against <a href=#>P. Diddy</a>, others a bit sillier — with new links popping up on a biweekly basis. The curious thing about these spats is that while there may have been crumbs laid in the last few years, most are pretty surprising for onlookers. And given how interconnected they are, it’s a little unwieldy to keep track of everything, especially who’s coming out victorious. The Great Beef Barbecue of 2024 kicked off with <a href=#>Megan Thee Stallion&nbsp;hurling fiery bars</a> directly at&nbsp;Nicki Minaj’s pink wig&nbsp;and her Cash Money classmate Drake on “Hiss” and it hasn’t slowed down since. A few top chefs are currently boasting the best brisket in rap … while the losers bum in the back of the kitchen scouring the trash bins for bones to gnaw on.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clv2jws3f003c3b7z043cmc6e@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Kendrick Lamar, Future, Rick Ross vs. J.Cole and Drake</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv2jwrrr00263b7zntrq55fa@published data-word-count=41>This beef started in earnest a few weeks ago with a response to last fall’s <a href=#>“First Person Shooter,” </a>where Cole and Drizzy placed themselves alongside Dot as this generation’s Big Three of rap. And, yeah, Kendrick didn’t like that at all.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clv2nsah700703b7zh1on2vhb@published>Kendrick Lamar: WINNER</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv2jxwum00413b7zt1z6e488@published data-word-count=127>It was a surprise to hear him go after J. Cole on the Future and Metro Boomin collab “Like That” if you weren’t keen to Jermaine’s routinely sneak-dissing K.Dot’s most recent album, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers. (His acclaimed guest verse on Lil Yachty’s “Secret Recipe” featured a dig at Cornrow Kenny: “Some activists got so rich, they prolly wish we stay oppressed / Studio steppers moving extra on songs, faking rep.”) At the heart of this diss though, is Kendrick calling their bluff: “Say, it’s a lot of goofies with a check / I mean, ah, I hope them sentiments symbolic / Ah, my temperament bipolar, I choose violence / Okay, let’s get it up, it’s time for him to prove that he’s a problem.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv2jwrrt00293b7zatkhf06x@published data-word-count=157>Now, granted Lamar has largely kept it cute when asked about the other two directly, he’s never shied away from the fact that he really doesn’t fuck with Drake. As far back as 2014, on records like “Pay for It” alongside former TDE labelmate Jay Rock, Dot raps “I tell ’em all to hail King Kendrick, resurrecting my vengeance / Been dissecting your motor mouth, ’til I break down the engine / This ain’t no warning shot, this a relevant henchman /&nbsp;See my opponent then, cease your existence / Ending our friendship.” Drake peeped game and responded with his own shots on “My Language,” noting that not only is Dot’s shit “not that inspiring” but also claimed that he is, indeed, “the motor mouth” and “the one you should worry bout.” They would trade barbs for years throughout the ’10s, never mentioning the other’s name directly. Keen ears could hear the cold war between the two titans.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clv2nsioj00773b7zf3pxn7m5@published>J. Cole: LOSER</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv2kh2xw004r3b7zeep1z8cc@published data-word-count=169>Cole tried, and then Cole failed to prove he was a real problem. A week after “7 Minute Drill,” he stepped up on his own Dreamville Festival stage, clutching a crystal, burning sage, before withdrawing his participation from the spiciest rap beef he made for himself. Even before the apology on April 5 — which was, one could argue, only offered because the disses on “Pi” and “7 Minute Drill” were quite weak — it was clear Cole was underwater. But Lamar probably heard the sneaks and been ready to body Cole. And while he hasn’t publicly apologized for his last beef with Noname (though she’s <a href=#>said they’ve talked about the whole “nigga you don’t read” thing privately)</a>, nor for the very unnecessary transphobia in “Pi,” Cole believes removing “7 Minute Drill” from streaming services is enough to satiate his spirit. <a href=#>Unless you count mans forgetting his verses onstage</a>. As someone who prides himself in rapping every word of his work live, the diss had that man experiencing nightmares.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clv2nw66d007e3b7z04g5sbza@published>Future: WINNER</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv2jwrrv002d3b7z7qj270lx@published data-word-count=82>It’s still not clear if Future actually has an axe to grind with Drake. There have been rumors for over ten years that these two secretly despise each other despite their 2015 joint mixtape, but he certainly wasn’t pressing Lamar to change up his verse&nbsp;or, at the very least, he wasn’t successful at it. Nah, Future’s just geeked to have one of the fiercest diss verses of the year so far on We Don’t Trust You, even if he didn’t contribute it.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clv2nwf6t007q3b7z7f6d9h41@published>Drake: WINNER (so far)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv2jwrrv002e3b7zc72w0nzq@published data-word-count=303>On April 13, an alleged leak of Drake’s response dropped and the comment sections, of course, ran wild despite speculation that it’s AI. On “Push-Ups,” the Canuck basically says Lamar was an indentured servant under Top Dog for not only taking an alleged 50-50 earnings split while he was at the label, but hitting military-style push-ups anytime the label head demanded with “drop and give me 50.” It’s an admittedly clever turn of phrase on top of a dig at Big Steppers: “Your last one bricked, you really not on shit, they make excuses for you ’cause they hate to see me lit.” He also made a bunch of short-king jokes:&nbsp;“Pipsqueak pipe down you ain’t no big three / SZA got you wiped down / Travis got you wiped down /&nbsp;Savage got you wiped down” and “I’m at the top of the mountain so you tight now / Just to have a talk with yo ass I had to hike down.” But he also cast a few strays in the direction of the Weeknd, who has <a href=#>historically denied</a> being a part of Drake’s factory of artists who only make songs for Drake; A$AP Rocky, who emptied the clip on Drake’s obsession with his partner, Rihanna, on We Still Don’t Trust You track “Show of Hands”; and … Rick Ross. The Rozay stray seemed outta nowhere but it also could shine some light on the more understated issue at hand: women. “I might take your latest girl and cuff her like I’m Ricky,” Drake adds. “Can’t believe he jumpin’ in, this nigga turning 50.” I chuckled — can’t lie about that one — but everybody involved in these beefs is much too old for it. If this is just round one, rumored AI Drake came for all the haters in a pretty efficient way.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clv2nwoqc007x3b7zgsck3wbp@published>Rick Ross: WINNER</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv2jwrrv002g3b7zsi5bj96z@published data-word-count=78>Rozay responded to the Drake diss within hours of its drop on April 15 by making fun of the Boy’s alleged plastic surgery on <a href=#>“Champagne Moments.”</a> He <a href=#>took up Pusha T’s generational diss</a> method in the outro, saying that Aubrey got a nose job so he wouldn’t look like his dad. We’re not here to body shame, but any beef that goes into a rapper’s personal villain origin story is a little more dangerous, and exponentially more fun.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clv2nwv1700843b7zd6klab6c@published>Metro Boomin’s Alleged Phone Hacker: LOSER</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv2jwrrv002i3b7zxphxgwhm@published data-word-count=59>On April 2, producer Metro Boomin claimed his phone <a href=#>was hacked by someone who put in five-figure orders&nbsp;on Balenciaga, Louis Vuitton, and Chanel</a>, but I’m not totally sure how he figures into this beef, outside of the hacker’s <a href=#>strange attempt to suggest Metro and 21 Savage have issues</a> and a series of spam calls from Toronto. The unmitigated gall.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clv2nx5iz008b3b7z066zbxov@published>The Simpsons, a Good TV Show: WINNER</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv2jwrrw002k3b7zyetx979e@published data-word-count=71>If anything, “7 Minute Drill” made clear that not only is reading beyond J. Cole,&nbsp;watching television is also not within his grasp. Claiming that Kendrick fell off “like The Simpsons” would mean that Cole hasn’t been keeping up. Now, is he wrong about that show falling off at one point? Absolutely. Is 2024 the year to point that out while it’s on its strongest run in more than a decade? No!</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clv2nxd6x008i3b7zxhgarof9@published>Big Sean: LOSER</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv2jwrrw002m3b7zjpyik7sw@published data-word-count=68>I hate calling him a loser because Big Sean really just makes his music, goes&nbsp;home, and loves on Jhené Aiko. But he did drop music in the midst of this beef that, to anyone other than his most ardent fans, just sorta came and went. He can’t duck Dot’s shadow to save his life — getting ate up on his own record, 2013’s “Control,” was only the beginning.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clv2jws5q003d3b7z5cujoqay@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>JT vs. Yung Miami</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv2jwrrw002o3b7zkjq6jabx@published data-word-count=50>To be honest it’s hard to tell why the City Girls&nbsp;beefed&nbsp;in public two weeks back. Something about sneak-dissing in tweets and on verses, apparently. Could the online brouhaha have had something to do <a href=#>with a very prominent hip-hop mogul in increasingly deep shit with federal law enforcement?</a> Who’s to say?</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clv2sr2z300123b7zfty6b0ra@published>JT: WINNER</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv2jwrrw002p3b7zu618w4n7@published data-word-count=120>Though JT was named in a lawsuit against Diddy, the beef is technically about possible insults on songs like <a href=#>“No Bars</a>,” where JT fires various shots at Latto and Cardi B, as well as her solo song&nbsp;<a href=#>“Sideways,”</a> where she raps “It’ll never be the same / Fuck the old days.” To which JT replied on Twitter on April 8 that in all of her songs, she’s always repped City Girls. She and Yung Miami <a href=#>went at it online for a little bit</a><strong> </strong>and then talked privately. This one kinda feels like a big nothing, but if we’re crowning a winner, it seems like the one who allegedly put their issues on wax and not just tweets gets the default dub.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clv2st9oy00173b7ztm92gkf2@published>Backhanded Compliments: WINNER</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv2jwrrx002r3b7zcrpxniuz@published data-word-count=81>I love how so much of their argument was the City Girls low-key gassing each other up.

Playing into, released a song about slapping rap bitches now it’s female unity?? CORNY!!!” Glo took the moment to kinda laugh at the insecurity, saying that her bars about “slapping rap bitches” on the early-year banger “Yeah Glo” could be about a bunch of rap bitches she’s slapped. “What you wanted me to say, I didn’t slap you but I hit you witha purse instead???” she <a href=#>wrote in a since-deleted tweet</a>, “Scary ass ho.” JT went on to deny the purse slap.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clv2sux05001z3b7z05fxs1ki@published>GloRilla: WINNER</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv2jwrry002w3b7z2yj9kren@published data-word-count=82>Regardless of if she did it or not, Glo comes outta this beef lookin strong for (a) dropping a record, “Yeah Glo,” that compels us to actually slap the taste outta somebody mouth, and (b) clarifying that it might not have been a slap but a purse smack. In any case, Glo didn’t lose the altercation behind the scenes and the intrigue over the veracity of the slap makes us only more interested in whatever mean rap-girl anthem she got coming next.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clv2suq4v001u3b7zkxp1imsy@published>Victoria Monét’s Messy Social-Media Manager: WINNER</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv2jwrry002y3b7zhsml38w2@published data-word-count=120>Apparently, Victoria Monét’s social-media manager was eating popcorn and cutting up while watching the Twitter brawl between GloRilla and JT like the rest of us. But unlike the rest of us, she happened to be signed into her bosses’ account when she reposted a tweet from JT showing her eight mugshots and forewarning a potential ninth, teasing upcoming fisticuffs with Glo. We still don’t really know if this was a mistake or on purpose, tbh, because self-sabotage, especially for a thankless job like social-media management, might not be the worst thing in the world. Whoever did it, they became the rare anonymous side character of the day, and they might’ve just left their gig for something better on the horizon.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clv2su750001p3b7zxpxqtk9m@published>Purse Designers: LOSER</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv2jwrrz00303b7zqobn1e83@published data-word-count=40>Do you know how much Kate Spade, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, or whatever could play up this squabble?

How does a person like Meek, who is always talking about how he’s not good with technology, continue to vomit all over himself on the internet? At this point, he’ll never be good at it.

Last year, after Doechii dropped a preview of her song “Alter Ego” featuring JT, folks on social media accused Doechii of swiping Banks’s style, claiming the track sounds a lot like “New Bottega.” Doechii was quiet after the backlash, but once it dropped March 29,&nbsp;hip-hop heads like D-Nice reiterated&nbsp;that Doechii’s getting a little too close to Banks’s shtick. On April 10, Banks acknowledged it on Instagram, commenting Doechii fans should be called “wannabes.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clv2nxyo3008p3b7z8zdi1y4n@published>Doechii: WINNER</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clv2jwrs0003a3b7zncfkj1cg@published data-word-count=91>Doechii finally clapped back, saying that it’s not her fault Banks is “selling bussy soap and I’m selling platinum records. Leave me alone PLEASE.” This one is pretty simple. While I think there is real credence to the idea that Doechii is filling a lane that Azealia once occupied, the fact is Doechii actually makes music right now and Azealia rarely does. It ain’t no rap beef if words aren’t coming out on wax.
