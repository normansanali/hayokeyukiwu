You could and I have — I have done this. I’ve just created storylines out of nowhere, just to see how well AI works. And learn how to use it and interface with it. And I think there’s a lot of potential there from a creative perspective. On at least building a great framework for a great story arc.</p><p>“I think that can have an impact as people become more familiar with AI as AI develops. And I mean, every single day, there’s more and more information and capabilities available to you using AI. So I think when that time comes… Which probably isn’t that far away, you’re going to find writers in wrestling as well as Hollywood. It’s one of the reasons for the Writer’s Strike right? They all saw this freight train coming. They know what’s gonna happen.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-eric-bischoff-is-convinced-that-ai-can-help-in-creating-storylines-and-building-characters>Eric Bischoff is convinced that AI can help in creating storylines and building characters</h2><p>Bischoff also mentioned that currently, the wrestling storylines are not that great excluding a few. AI can be highly helpful in that regard.</p><p>“And I believe it will happen because again I’m just playing around with it. I went, ‘Oh! This is actually kind of possible. [That you could create characters and create story arcs with the requisite plot points along the way to make it really a storyline and a story arc as opposed to just a wrestling angle.]’ Which is typically what we hear about today. With the exception of the Bloodline and some of the other stories are really well-disciplined, well-structured storylines. But the rest of them are just excuses for a match that we call storylines.</p><p>“But with AI you could take somebody that doesn’t have that formal storytelling structure and understanding of structure and have them plug in the requisite elements and boom! It spits it back to you and what looks like a pretty interesting story. And then you go back and tweak it and f*** with it to make it really wrestling. But… Yeah! That’s what I see as far as using AI to create the presentation, beyond the creative underpinnings of it. I don’t see that but that’s probably because I don’t know enough about it,” Eric Bischoff said. &nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsa3JxZGKys7XCZpmiq5OdvKeyjJucpaGVq7K0ecCiZJyZnmK1prjPZqerp12sv6a%2F06Wgp59dm7%2BwuYyaZJyqlZbBqsLEZqeeqqOlsqTAyK%2Bc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
