Depp himself confessed to the romance during a previous court battle, that time when Depp took the British tabloid The Sun <a href=#>to court</a>.</p><p>Speaking in the courtroom in July 2020, he shared, via <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, that they'd "been friends for a number of years" before a "sexual element began," explaining that they got together romantically in the wake of her split from her now former husband, Gabriel Byrne. Depp explained that they were intimate "for months on and off" while filming "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," but claimed Barkin was supposedly looking for more from their dalliance than he was. "She wanted more than a relationship, she wanted a proper relationship with me and I did not want that," he claimed. The actor then suggested they hadn't spoken since then, noting, "I didn't feel the same about her as she did me and I suppose from that moment on she became very, very angry."</p><p>Depp suggested those unrequited feelings may have been why Barkin had spoken negatively about him in a statement read out to the court. <a href=#>Page Six</a> claimed Barkin accused her ex of once throwing a wine bottle in her direction after she claimed he became jealous and got upset with her. Depp denied that claim though, calling the allegation "untrue."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcW5gbYFye8inqqKclWK3sLTNp7BmnJWlvbR50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZLChpJ16prjLnqVmmpGnuKq6jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
