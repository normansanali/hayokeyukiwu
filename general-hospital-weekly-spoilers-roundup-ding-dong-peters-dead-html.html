After months of speculation, supposition, and hopes and prayers, <a href=#>Peter August is finally dead</a>! Maxie can breathe again! But there are some spoilers that suggest he might be back for one last go-around — and that’s just the beginning of the fallout, the drama, and the mess up ahead in Port Charles.</p><p id=par-2_12><strong>[Spoiler alert: Potential spoilers for upcoming episodes of General Hospital are ahead.]</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/General-Hospital-17.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-on-general-hospital-peter-finally-got-murdered>On ‘General Hospital,’ Peter finally got murdered</h2><p id=par-3_57>On the Feb. 23 episode of General Hospital, Anna watched as Peter took his last breath. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Soaps.com</a>, Felicia bonked him in the head to save her daughter’s life, and who could blame her? And after that, she assured the long-suffering Maxie that her crazy baby daddy was no longer going to be an issue.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_91>“Anna admits she’s soft-hearted and always tries to see the good in people. He’s so much like his father: obsessed and entitled. As long as he’s alive, Maxie will not be safe,” reports the outlet. “There is no ambulance coming and she’s advised the WSB to stay away. She won’t let him die alone. Even he doesn’t deserve that and she hopes he has some peace wherever he ends up. Peter dies. Anna sobs, closes his eyes, and double-checks his pulse. “It’s over. Goodbye Peter,” she says, stumbling off in tears.”</p><p id=par-5_22>Premium soap content right here, folks! Of course, in true soap fashion, there’s some speculation that Peter might not really be dead.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>But some spoilers suggest he might not really be dead</h2><p id=par-6_99>While Peter certainly bit the proverbial bullet in a rather graphic way, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Soaps.com</a> is under the impression that the villain will be popping up on future episodes of General Hospital. Certainly, fans of daytime dramas know that no one’s ever really dead in soap opera land. (Well, maybe <a href=#>Luke Spencer</a> really is. How is anyone going to explain Luke coming back from the dead when his ashes are all over the place?) But the outlet is under the impression that his death wasn’t really that “satisfying,” something that showrunners promised it would be when it was first teased.</p><p id=par-7_53>“You know what’s not rewarding? To have one of the smartest women on the show weep over the body of someone who did horrible things to both her and everyone she loves,” reports the outlet. “Which has us convinced that — as has happened before — rumors of Peter’s death are greatly exaggerated.”</p><p id=par-8_32>The outlet further speculates that Peter will turn up again sometime soon — and it will be interesting to see where the story goes if he’s not really dead this time around.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meanwhile, elsewhere in Port Charles</h2><p id=par-9_60>While Felicia, Maxie, et. al. are dealing with the fallout of Peter’s death, the latest General Hospital spoilers from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celeb Dirty Laundry</a> reveal that even in the midst of what’s shaping up to be a super-nasty divorce, Sonny can’t seem to shake Nina from his mind. (But he really loves Carly, too! Yeah, the man is a little confused.)</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_70>Look for Sonny to agonize over his feelings for Nina in true Sonny fashion on the Feb. 25 episode of the show. Now, the outlet also teases that Carly will acquire some interesting intel on Nina. It, most likely, refers to the Nina-Willow mother-daughter situation — especially since it’s been teased that the “<a href=#>big reveal</a>” is coming soon — so Carly will save that information for a rainy day.</p><p id=par-11_11>General Hospital is definitely going to be a barn-burner this week!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS0prrEq5ilZZikwLG105qjZq%2BVmritxYysp6ihnJq%2FtHnRqKynnKWleqW1zaBknaeenHqxsdOeqaxllJqupXrHraSlZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
