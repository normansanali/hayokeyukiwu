While a lot of readers might know her mainly for her incredible work as Rebecca Pearson in This Is Us, her public life started in the '90s as a singer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although her focus shifted mostly to acting, music will always be her first love. So it makes sense that she would want to date a musician she admires. That musician being Taylor Goldsmith from the band Dawes. She was a huge fan of his music, and that's how they connected and eventually fell in love.</p><h2 id=how-did-mandy-moore-and-taylor-goldsmith-meet>How Did Mandy Moore And Taylor Goldsmith Meet?</h2><p>Even celebrities are not immune to the way technology has changed how people relate to each other.</p><p>The way Mandy Moore met Taylor Goldsmith, the man she would eventually fall in love with and who would become her husband, is not that much different from how ordinary people meet their dates every day; it was through Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They were both fans of each other, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was Mandy who took the first step</a>. She has always loved Taylor's band, Dawes, and it was through a post she made gushing about their music that he realized he had a shot with her.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What's Next For Mandy Moore After 'This Is Us'?</a></span></p><p>"I took a picture of their album and posted it on Instagram. Somehow, Taylor saw it and sent a note to me. We started emailing back and forth, then we went on a date and the rest is history. Thanks, Instagram, for helping me meet my fiancé!" Mandy said a few years ago.</p><h2 id=their-relationship-moved-slowly-at-first>Their Relationship Moved Slowly At First</h2><p>Although the connection between Mandy Moore and Taylor Goldsmith was practically immediate, it took a long time until they actually moved forward in their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was not because they weren't sure about their compatibility or anything like that. It was because their schedules were too full when they started seeing each other.</p><p>Mandy was incredibly busy shooting This Is Us, and Taylor was on tour with his band. That didn't deter them, though. They knew from the start that what they had was special.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Emotional Reason Mandy Moore Is Taking A Break From Acting</a></span></p><p>"We spent hours FaceTiming each other," Mandy said. "We fell in love before we’d even really held hands or kissed or anything. It was great."</p><p>The couple got engaged in 2017 and married the following year. The ceremony was small and private, held in Mandy's house, which was the perfect thing for both of them.</p><p>Despite their careers, that constantly put them in the spotlight, they don't really want that kind of attention for personal affairs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We are both pretty quiet, private people. I never imagined myself with some beautiful dress in front of 300 people. It will be quiet and private — just for us," she said when they announced their engagement.</p><h2 id=mandy-moore-was-going-through-a-rough-patch-when-she-met-taylor-goldsmith>Mandy Moore Was Going Through A Rough Patch When She Met Taylor Goldsmith</h2><p>Before she met Taylor, Mandy Moore was going through a difficult time, and it took a couple of years for her to completely get over it. Falling in love certainly helped, but her work in This Is Us was also key for her getting back on track.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I had a few years of just unhappiness," Mandy shared. "From a career perspective, I felt like I was barely treading water. I was really discouraged and dismayed at the sort of opportunities that weren’t presenting themselves any longer. That coincided with my personal life not being in a great place," she continued, <a href=#>referring to her divorce from her first husband, Ryan Adams</a>, which took place in 2015.</p><p>At one point, she finally decided to stop trying to power through and really allow herself to work on her mental health, which did wonders.</p><p>"I stopped, I regrouped, I got myself better situated, and six months later [This is Us] came around. And I was ready for it. I’ve never been part of a project where [fans] are so willing to be vulnerable and talk about their lives. It’s pretty mind-boggling. And [the cast] is one big family. We all dig in and do the work and connect to it every single day. Every day I drive into work I’m like, 'Thank you, universe!'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not too long after, when her husband came into her life, she was stable and comfortable enough to start a new relationship.</p><h2 id=the-couple-is-happier-than-ever>The Couple Is Happier Than Ever</h2><p>Seven years after meeting, Mandy and Taylor are still going strong. They are still hopelessly in love with each other, and their beautiful family continues to grow happily.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Mandy Moore Reclaimed Her Voice And Made Her Way Back To Music After So Long</a></span></p><p>In early 2021, the couple welcomed their first child together, August "Gus" Harrison Goldsmith, and then they made Gus a big brother. Their youngest boy, Oscar "Ozzie" Bennett Goldsmith was born on October 21st, 2022, and the family couldn't be happier.</p><p>We wish the couple and their lovely kids all the happiness in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecyapZ2xXaK8sL7EZqSenaRitaa%2BjKGsrJqRo7FuwMCyo6iqXZy8rbDSpqCtoF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
