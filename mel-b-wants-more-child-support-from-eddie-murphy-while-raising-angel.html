Melanie is a singer, songwriter and television personality. Eddie is a legendary comedian and actor. Until recently, Melanie has been fortunate in her career to sustain a comfortable lifestyle for herself and Angel. Unfortunately, Melanie’s income has dramatically reduced, such that she must consider modifying child support for the first time.”</p><p>The<a href=#> X Factor </a>judge’s legal team has allegedly made “numerous efforts to resolve this case without court intervention without any success,” they went on to write. “Melanie was left with no choice but to file this.”</p><p>The actress has requested a January court hearing. In her and Murphy’s previous agreement from 2009, she was given sole physical custody of their daughter. The comedian, on the other hand, was ordered to pay $25,000 a month. Murphy was also required to cover Angel’s health insurance and health costs, as well as contribute to her educational expenses.
