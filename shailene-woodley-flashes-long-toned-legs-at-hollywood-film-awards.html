The metallic jumpsuit — which also features a cut-out back with a black velvet bow that displayed her strong back — is by Ralph & Russo.</p><p>Woodley, who launched to fame in the young-adult Divergent series, has long been known for her devotion to alternative health methods. But for her recent role in <a href=# rel=noopener>Adrift</a>, the real-life story of a sailor lost at sea that was released this summer, she had to completely transform her physicality. “There was a lot of physical activity in the movie,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>Livestrong.com</a>&nbsp;in July. “Before we commenced production, I did training with a local Fijian trainer who was great. We did a lot of functional training, so it wasn’t so much weights or weight machines as much as it was functional fitness and using the elements to build particular strength.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The 26-year-old actress also admitted to eating an extremely <a href=# rel=noopener>calorie-restricted diet</a> during filming — which she would not recommend: “For about two weeks towards the end of filming I was eating one can of salmon, two egg yolks and some steamed vegetables, and that was it. And that was gnarly.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Shailene-Woodley-legs3.jpg><p>And though the yoga devotee stepped up her fitness routine for the open-sea adventure, having a workout regimen has long been a priority for her. “It’s important for me to feel physically strong in my day to day life,” she told the Los Angeles Times in 2016. “I’ve done jujitsu. Krav Maga. I really love martial arts. There’s a YouTube video called Perfect Lean Body. This woman does leg workouts. They’re 20 minutes long and you sweat and kick your …. But they’re only 20 minutes. It’s fantastic. I use this app called Tabata Timer. It’s high interval training.”</p><p>The self-care aspect of consistent sweat sessions fits with Woodley’s entire life philosophy. As she <a href=# rel=noopener>told Us Weekly</a> in April at the All It Takes Youth Leadership Organization Event, her best advice to young people is “to know our worth outside of any external validation. I think that’s the number one thing we have to recognize. And to listen before you speak.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGasoJGeuaa6xGauqKeUobK6ecWlmKyglah6rbvNoGStp56asW64xKCqZpmkYrWwuMuyrqinlGKzqrjMZpiwmaKZwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
