Playing it lets you <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">design your protagonist from start to finish</a>, detailing their physical build, wardrobe, tattoos, jewelry, and voice.</p><p data-injection=true>The intricacies and new additions of the remake’s character creator are on full display in Boss Factory. New to the Saints Row remake are customizable teeth, vein patterns, and optional prosthetic limbs. Faces can be more accurately sculpted thanks to uniquely adjustable body groups for every part of the face, with both sides of the face being independently and asymmetrically adjustable.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Saints Row reboot sold me with an ice cream cone, a mailbox, and a port-a-potty – Hands-on Preview</a></p><p data-injection=true>Once you’re finished perfecting your new Saint’s appearance, you can save their design in the cloud, connected to the account of the platform you play Boss Factory on.

Versions of the demo exist for both the Playstation 4 and 5, as well as the entire suite of Xbox One and Series consoles. As the remake is slated to launch as an Epic Games Store exclusive on PC, look for Boss Factory on that platform as well.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/71cbda4f096528433fdaf76fe4b519db?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Tom Griffin</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc></p><h4><a href=#>More Stories by Tom Griffin</a></h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qK3Mnqeuql6YvK57xq6gnZ2jZLWww4ytpmaclai2qLqMsqauql2YtaK%2BwJyrnqpdnrtuv8Cipa2rXae8uHnEmqmlsQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
