The filing revealed that the oldest son "repeatedly physically threatened to harm or kill" but Frankie and Emilio, "part of a pattern for the past several months".&nbsp;</p><p id=eJRZNo-cxzJ data-wc=36>The report, obtained by <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">People</a>, continued that the family believed Francesco was "addicted to opiates", and Frankie's plans to continue financially supporting him were contingent on his son's agreement to enter a residential drug treatment program.</p><p id=e5GZJLO-YAN data-wc=28>A rep for the musician said: "Frankie is saddened by these unfortunate events and appreciates that his privacy will be respected as he works out these family issues."&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Emilio and Brando</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4923ebe63e91-gettyimages-2150742265.jpg><p id=e3pDhbc7inT data-wc=42>The twins are Frankie's sons from his third marriage to Randy, born in 1995.
