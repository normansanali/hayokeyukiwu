The filing revealed that the oldest son "repeatedly physically threatened to harm or kill" but Frankie and Emilio, "part of a pattern for the past several months".&nbsp;</p><p id=eJRZNo-cxzJ data-wc=36>The report, obtained by <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">People</a>, continued that the family believed Francesco was "addicted to opiates", and Frankie's plans to continue financially supporting him were contingent on his son's agreement to enter a residential drug treatment program.</p><p id=e5GZJLO-YAN data-wc=28>A rep for the musician said: "Frankie is saddened by these unfortunate events and appreciates that his privacy will be respected as he works out these family issues."&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Emilio and Brando</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4923ebe63e91-gettyimages-2150742265.jpg><p id=e3pDhbc7inT data-wc=42>The twins are Frankie's sons from his third marriage to Randy, born in 1995.

She first saw the drummer aged 15, and she "fell in love with him the first time I ever saw him".
