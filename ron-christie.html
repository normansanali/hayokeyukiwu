I'm not happy about it. ... The leadership starts at the top, and I think that Chairman <a href=#>Michael Steele</a> is on a very short leash, he has a very, very narrow opportunity to show that he can raise the money, that he can be a strong leader for the party. Otherwise, I think perhaps the clock in the back of his head in his office might be ticking".</p><p>Christie worked as a summer intern for Congressman <a href=#>Tom Campbell</a>. At the beginning of his career, he served as counsel to Senator <a href=#>George Allen</a> of Virginia and as senior advisor to former House Budget Committee Chairman and future Governor of Ohio <a href=#>John Kasich</a>.

Christie was selected by Bush to lead an American delegation to an international conference on volunteerism and civic engagement hosted by Prime Minister Tony Blair in London.</p><p>Ronald I.
