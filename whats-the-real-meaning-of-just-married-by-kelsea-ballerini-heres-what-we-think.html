The title of the track can be a nod to the happiness someone feels when they are just married, even mentioning the "just married" sign that is often hung on the back of the car after a wedding. The wedding is just the start of a new chapter with someone, and it can be a fun and exhilarating time.</p><p dir=ltr>For Ballerini, the thought of marriage was scary at first. But that was until she met Morgan Evans. "It was an instant connection," she said in an interview with <a href=#>Access Hollywood</a>. "As soon as I met [Evans], he was just careful with the way that I love, and I always felt very safe letting him."</p><p>The "half of my hometown" singer also opened up about the fact that her parent's divorce affected her outlook on love and marriage. "I swore I was never going to get married," she told <a href=#>People</a> in November 2021. "I have a different idea of marriage, but I would think I have a healthier idea of marriage." She mentioned that she and Evans had been in couple's therapy before. "We approach our relationship so differently, but he shows up — he shows up in every way he needs to," she added. But it seems that "Just Married" also has a much deeper meaning that reflects on the downfall of the relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampgZX95hY6wn5qso2LBqbGMq5yapF2isqK6yKeeZqeWYre2v9NmpJqqop6ypXnBsmSknZyosqJ5wZqjpZ2inruqeceeqZ6rXay1osCMsJxmrJieu6x7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
