He is a queer barber who stands in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and the police who condemn the hashtag ACAB. Haynesworth-Polen reveals that he is Aries on his Instagram bio, where he also warns people: “IF I DON’T KNOW YOU, I DON’T ACCEPT YOUR REQUEST.” Haynesworth-Polen’s biggest reveal was perhaps a series of multiple Instagram photo posts with Frey.</p><p>Haynesworth-Polen has 2,190 followers on Instagram and his account is private. However, alleged screenshots circulating on Twitter reveal that he captioned the post with Frey: “I’m so ready for this year to end, excited to see what next year brings.” Geotagged in Los Angeles, California, the post is from January 1, according to the screenshot.</p><p>The image is that of Frey, with his arms around Haynesworth-Pollen, both of them grinning at the camera with big smiles. As soon as the photo went viral, a user recognized Frey’s boyfriend from the selfie, noting, “This is really funny because I don’t know who Casey Frey is, but her boyfriend dyed my hair in my bedroom when I was in the room. college”.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>this is so funny bc idk who casey frey is but his bf dyed my hair in my dorm when i was in college https://t.co/JfuKUUwnhy</p><p>— sadgirldiaries (@sadgirIdiaries) June 15, 2021</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joshua-haynesworth-polen-age></span>Joshua Haynesworth-Polen Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Joshua Elias Haynesworth-Polen</strong> is 30 years old.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cozies-up-with-beau-in-viral-selfie></span>Cozies up with beau in viral selfie<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The internet just found out that Casey Frey has a boyfriend and they’re losing him. The news came in the late hours of June 15, presumably from a post by Frey’s boyfriend that appears to have become an overnight sensation. For those who don’t remember, Frey was the creator of ‘Darren’ Vine, which gained popularity alongside comedians such as Gabbie Hanna and Logan Paul.</p><p>Since a photo of Frey and his alleged boyfriend went viral, Twitter has been divided. While many welcomed the dancer and comedian to the LGBTQ ++ community, calling it the latest announcement of Pride Month, others are left sobbing because Frey has a boyfriend but it’s not them. With equal doses of warmth and celebration, Frey’s fans seem to have welcomed his boyfriend in loving acceptance of him, but who is this mystery man you ask? From the selfie screenshots that went viral, Frey’s boyfriend’s Instagram username reveals it as @yung_thiccums. This is all we know about the man who stole Frey’s heart.</p><p>Some fans quickly realized how happy the two of them look together. “CASEY FREY HAS A BOYFRIEND! BOY! FRIEND !!! Nature is healing,” announced a Twitter user. Another celebrated: “Casey Frey having a boyfriend is the best thing he can happen all week, happy pride month to all.” Other fans of the comedian known for his unique dance skills were ripped apart. Sobbing through a tweet, and with a photo of a dejected Logan Lerman from the “Baked as a cake” scene on ‘Perks of Being a Wallflower, a fan tweeted: “I’m so happy for Casey Frey and her b-boyfriend … I really wish you all the luck and happiness. ”</p><p>Other fans made no secret of their anguish over not being Frey’s lover. “So Casey Frey has a boyfriend and it’s NOT me?” one asked, along with a gif of Whoopi Goldberg saying “okay.” Another tweeted: “Casey Frey has a boyfriend and I’m not the one who hates this life, they are so cute even though I adore them.” A third fan also said, “I’m so upset that I just found out that Casey Frey has a boyfriend that I mean good for him, but I wish it was me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKfqLW2rYyhmLKmlajEsL7ToWSpp5yau7R5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpecGipqCqkaW1unnFmpqtZZOWv6ax0WaYsJmimcBurc2dZKWhlpp6tMDOq7Bo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
