Prior to announcing the nominees, however, he sang a few lines of Travis’ hit song “Forever and Ever, Amen.”</p><p>“That classic song won Song of the Year in 1987, and the man who sang it has had an amazing comeback to be with us tonight,” he said by way of introduction. “Ladies and gentleman, the great Randy Travis!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Cameras then panned to the “I Told You So” singer in the audience. Amid wild cheers from the crowd, he rose slowly to his feet, smiling and nodding in acknowledgement of the applause.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/Lee-Brice-Randy-467.jpg>Travis has not been seen or heard from much since July 2013, when he was hospitalized in critical condition after emergency brain surgery. After the ACMs, however, he took to his website with a letter to fans.<p>“It was an amazing gift to feel all of the love from you tonight in Dallas at the Academy of Country Music Awards,” he wrote. “It has been a hard fought and miraculous journey since my stroke two years ago, and I have gained a greater understanding of God’s grace and how quickly events can change us.”</p><p>He went on to express gratitude for the “kind cards and heartfelt letters” he received from fans, noting that he hoped to one day be able to return to the stage. “The power of music remains a source of inspiration and healing for me,” he shared. “Writing songs was always a passion of mine and I still have a lot to share with you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmappSuerW%2BwK%2BgrGWdlrimv4yrmKudXaW8tMCMrKurp5uaeqK8z56Yq5memLJurdNmmJylXZbEor7DrGRraGFqenN8kG5paWxf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
