Charlton’s biggest triumph came in 1966 when he guided England to a World Cup victory and was awarded the famous Golden Ball trophy. With a career total of 49 goals for England and a record 249 goals for Manchester United, his goal-scoring prowess was unrivaled.&nbsp;He also led Manchester United to three Football League First Division wins and was awarded the Ballon d’Or in 1966. Charlton held the record for the most England national game appearances until David Beckham overtook him.</p><h2>Bobby Charlton’s Son: Who Is He?</h2><p>The great English footballer Sir <strong>Bobby Charlton</strong> was a loving family guy, yet he and his wife, Norma Ball, had no sons.&nbsp;They were instead blessed with two daughters, <strong>Suzanne and Andrea Charlton</strong>.&nbsp;The lack of a son raised eyebrows among football fans, who are used to seeing brilliant players’ legacies carried on by their male descendants. In Bobby Charlton’s case, however, no male heir could carry on the Charlton football legacy.</p><p>Bobby and Norma Charlton’s daughters, Suzanne and Andrea Charlton, have different paths in life. While many kids follow in the footsteps of their great-dads in football, the Charlton family’s narrative is unique. Despite the speculation of a “Charlton” boy being a football great, Sir Bobby Charlton’s legacy was carried on by his daughters in their own unique ways. <strong>Bobby Charlton’s family</strong> included his wife, Norma, and their two daughters, Suzanne and Andrea.&nbsp;The lack of a boy meant that there would be no male successor to carry on the footballing heritage, but the Charlton girls took their own separate courses in life, making their mark in many professions.</p><h2>Bobby Charlton’s Daughter: Suzanne and Andrea Charlton</h2><p><strong>Bobby Charlton</strong> and his wife, <strong>Norma Ball</strong>, have two kids following their marriage in 1961.&nbsp;In contrast to their renowned father, his daughters, Suzanne and Andrea Charlton, have had fairly secluded lives.&nbsp;Suzanne, born in 1962, diverged from her father’s footballing profession to work as a weather forecaster for the BBC in the 1990s.&nbsp;She attended Loreto Grammar School, a Roman Catholic girls’ grammar school in Altrincham, where she most likely obtained a well-rounded education.</p><p>Suzanne continued her studies at the University of Reading, where she earned a degree in Physics and Meteorology in 1985. Andrea’s activities were not as publicly recognized, but she, like her sister, did not pursue a career in professional football. Instead, they pursued their own interests and jobs. She married Nick Brown, a tennis coach and former player, in 1994. The couple has a son called Robert, who continues on Sir Bobby Charlton’s heritage.&nbsp;Suzanne’s hobbies have centered on sports such as football, tennis, and skiing.</p><p>She even played hockey in college, demonstrating her athleticism.&nbsp;She has also participated in national horse-riding competitions and is a group teacher with the Riding for the Disabled Association.&nbsp;In contrast, there is little public information regarding <strong>Andrea Charlton</strong>, Sir Bobby Charlton’s second daughter.&nbsp;The spotlight has mostly been on Suzanne, who has been a more conspicuous presence in both her professional and personal lives.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZqJqSrnqktMCro62nnmKwqbXLnamepl2stbB5wKucZqulr66vusRmmKecXZa7pb7EmmScoJGnubW7zWauoqOZYq6vsIyfmKahnK58</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
