In several videos, Swift and Kelce can be seen packing on the PDA. They were also spotted <a href=#>serenading each other</a> to some of Swift’s other songs throughout the night.</p><p>Swift gave an inside look to the party herself when she shared a TikTok of her and <a href=#>her family attending the party</a> which ended up being a rager at the Wynn Las Vegas nightclub.</p><p>“Accidentally going clubbing with your parents is something everyone should try at least once in their life,” Swift captioned the clip.</p><p>The footage began with Kelce smiling and sticking his tongue out in the crowded venue. The camera then panned to her mom and dad, Andrea and Scott Swift, sitting in a booth beside their daughter. As her parents had wide eyes looking around the room, Taylor playfully poked fun at the awkward moment.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s a friends and family party they said,” Taylor wrote in the video. “Bring your parents they said.”</p><p>In addition to having her parents by her side, Taylor was joined by longtime pal <strong>Keleigh Teller</strong>, Travis’ brother, <strong>Jason Kelce</strong>, and more. Teller, 31, shared a compilation from <a href=#>the group’s time</a> at the party which included Jason, 36, wearing a Chiefs wrestling mask and matching overalls as he partied alongside <strong>Marshmello</strong> who was DJing the event.</p><p>“Just jason things,” Teller captioned videos of the Eagles center while tagging his wife, Kylie Kelce.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWUp7avt9JmqqKml6h6orrTomShnaKkeqLAjGtna2xdqMKxsdFmmaivnGK9or7TsmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
