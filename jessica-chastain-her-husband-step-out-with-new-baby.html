The couple <a href=#>said “I do” in June 2017</a> at an estate in Treviso, Italy, that belongs to the fashion executive’s family. <a href=#><strong>Anne Hathaway</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Emily Blunt</strong></a> were among those in attendance.</p><p>While the couple made it to the altar, <a href=#>getting married wasn’t always part of Chastain’s plan</a>.
