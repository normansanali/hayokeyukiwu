The show has been incredibly popular and led to the spinoffs:&nbsp;Home Town: Takeover&nbsp;and&nbsp;Home Town: Ben’s Workshop.&nbsp;Aside from the HGTV show, Ben and Erin are also co-owners of the shop Laurel Mercantile, and he’s also the owner of Scotsman Co, according to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>HGTV bio</a>. The pair also co-wrote the memoir&nbsp;Make Something Good Today.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ben Napier After His Weight Loss Journey</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Fans have taken notice of the&nbsp;Home Town&nbsp;host’s weight loss in his recent Instagram posts, including photos of him with his family members where he looks slimmer. “What happened to Ben? Who is that skinny dude?” one fan wrote under a photo of the two HGTV hosts rocking matching&nbsp;<strong>Chris Stapleton&nbsp;</strong>t-shirts.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Erin has shared quite a few photos gushing over how fantastic her husband looks, including a recent <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video</a>, praising him for getting “hardcore” about his weight loss on July 17, 2023. In the clip, Ben was showing off a suit, and she wrote “mission accomplished” while speaking about his fitness journey. She’s also posted some <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> of him wood-working shirtless, back in March 2023.</p><h2>Why Did Ben Decide To Lose Weight?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Ben’s health was a major factor in his decision to work out more. In the video praising him for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his weight loss</a>, Erin revealed that upcoming shoulder surgery was the driving factor for him. “[Ben] got hardcore about his health and fitness last winter ahead of his big shoulder surgery that was in march so he could sleep better on his back and lower his [blood pressure],” she wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Ben’s health journey has been documented in Home Town,&nbsp;according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;He also opened up about why he was trying to get in better shape in a February 2018 Instagram <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>post</a>. “I come from a long line of big men who don’t really discuss their health until it’s an issue,” he wrote, explaining that his dad had to undergo emergency bypass surgery.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>He revealed that his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>daughters</a>&nbsp;<strong>Helen,&nbsp;</strong>5, and <strong>Mae, </strong>2,&nbsp;were a key <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>part of his decision</a> to lose weight. “Although I have made efforts to eat healthy and to exercise, it never seemed more real until I held this blue-eyed girl that is equal parts Erin & me and a whole lot more than I deserve in my arms. I never want to leave her side, which means taking care of my heart has to be a major priority,” he wrote on Instagram.</p><h2>Ben Napier’s Diet & Exercise</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>While Ben hasn’t shared many details about his most recent weight loss journey, he did open up about some of his strategies in a Jan. 2019 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Today</a>. “I’ve always done well with cutting carbs. I try to stick to a low-carb diet until Thanksgiving every year and I try to do a good mix of cardio and weights five days a week. Most weeks, it ends up only being four days,” he explained. “I don’t get bored playing basketball, and could play for hours if I had the time. I’ve also done some intermittent fasting a couple of days a week.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8GepWamkaW2pr6MsJyin5ipeq270qxkbmlja4ByfY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
