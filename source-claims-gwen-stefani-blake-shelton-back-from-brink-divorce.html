"They'd been fighting a lot, and their schedules have been challenging for them. Gwen and Blake felt they had fallen out of love."

"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In my own relationship</a>, even though I know the truth of what's happening today, you still create drama in your own mind about your insecurities and what might happen. I was in that phase of the relationship with Blake and getting paranoid." She continued, "The truth is I am in love with my best friend, and all this s*** I'm thinking of in my brain, that's all it is — I'm overthinking."</p><p>While it is clear that the singer feels very strongly about her husband, she admitted to noticing the divorce reports. "But when you're in love and have truly aligned values, nobody can get to us," she said. "You can say whatever you want to say about our relationship — I mean, a week ago, we were getting divorced again or something. It's just lies.
