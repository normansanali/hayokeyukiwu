But things started to sour soon enough as Cam began sending sneak disses toward Jay-Z in his music.</p><p id=par-3_81>In 2002, Cam was announced as the vice president of Roc-A-Fella, which was co-founded by Jay-Z and <a href=#>Dame Dash</a> in 1996, while Jay-Z was away on vacation. He reportedly didn’t approve of the move. The following year, Jay-Z and Nas were embroiled in an infamous rap beef, and when Nas took a shot at Cam’ron, the <a href=#>Dipset</a> rapper decided to join the fray, releasing the diss track “Show You How,” a freestyle over Jay-Z’s song of the same name.</p><p id=par-4_39>In 2006, Cam’ron released “You Got To Love It,” a diss track aimed at Jay-Z. In the song, he alleged that Hov blocked him from taking the VP job at Roc-A-Fella. After that, however, things began to subside.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>They eventually made up</h2><p id=par-5_32>Cam’ron reflected on his once-tense relationship with Hov in a 2022 interview on <a href=#>Million Dollaz Worth of Game</a>. He stated plainly that he retaliated against Jay by tweaking his own music.</p><p id=par-6_53>“Hov did a remix for ‘Oh Boy,’ and I erased it,” Cam’ron said of his 2002 single. “Looking back on it I should have [saved it], because…&nbsp;S***, I could’ve got some money.” He pointed out that Jay also erased his verse from “One for Peedi Crakk” from the <a href=#>Paid in Full</a> soundtrack.</p><p id=par-7_39>“I was just so caught up,” Cam’ron admitted.&nbsp;“I’m very, very petty, man. But looking back on that you made a great point, we should have kept it, and whether we used it or not we should’ve had it.”</p><p id=par-8_8>“That was just my mentality at the time.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jay-z-brought-out-nas-and-cam-ron-at-a-concert>Jay-Z brought out Nas and Cam’ron at a concert</h2><p id=par-9_32>Jay-Z performed at New York City’s Terminal 5 in 2019 in what was an unforgettable show for fans. Two special guests that Jay brought out that night were Nas and Cam’ron.</p><p id=par-10_61>Cam’ron admitted that that was the first time he had spoken to Jay in “forever.” But despite their issues in the past during Cam’s time with Roc-A-Fella and Def Jam, the two took the stage together for a performance of their 2002 collab “Welcome to New York City” from Come Home with Me, the same album that contained “Oh Boy.”</p><p id=par-11_43>“Jay called, he’s like, ‘Yo, first of all I want to tell you I got respect for you,’ and I’m like, ‘Same here, bro,’” he said. “S*** ain’t no big thing, man. We talking about some s***, f***ing 12-13 years old. I’m straight.”</p><p id=par-12_34>“We just showed our love for each other, and we kept it under wraps,” he said, noting the audience’s shock when he they reunited on stage. “Nobody would’ve thought that in a million years.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS2r7%2FInZxmopGuert5wpqkq6eeqHqjscSfZaGsnaF8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
