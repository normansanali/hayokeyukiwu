There are several reasons you could consider Rosemary’s Baby to be cursed. The 1968 film, directed by the incredibly controversial Roman Polanski, saw strange circumstances befall a number of people attached, including the film’s composer Krzysztof Komeda, who reportedly fell into a coma and eventually died, much like Rosemary’s friend Hutch does in the book."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He ended up in the hospital and, delirious, reportedly hallucinated scenes from the film —&nbsp;and he never made another Hollywood hit.</p><p>However, it was one year after the film’s release that the most infamous disaster would occur. At the time, director Roman Polanski was married to Hollywood actress <a href=# rel=noopener>Sharon Tate</a>, who was pregnant with their first child. Tragedy struck in August 1969, when Tate was murdered by the Manson Family, along with the unborn child.</p><p>The public quickly began to connect the Manson Family murders with growing worries that led to the Satanic Panic. Some suggested that Polanski had offered Tate as a sacrifice to maintain his status in Hollywood. Others suggested the Manson Family were Satanists, lumping the Beatles in as well due to their song “Helter Skelter” — the words which were written in blood at the scene of Tate’s murder.</p><p>Writer Ira Levin, who first penned the novel Rosemary’s Baby, later expressed guilt that his work had “played a significant part in all this popularization of the occult and belief in witchcraft and Satanism.”</p><p>“I really feel a certain degree of guilt about having fostered that kind of irrationality,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonykwdGsnJ1lnaTDqrHSaGw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
