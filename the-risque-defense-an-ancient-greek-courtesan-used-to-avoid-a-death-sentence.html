However, courtesans like Phryne had more freedom in ancient Greece than many other women. As a result, more opportunities were available to them, including the opportunity to obtain more education, according to the <a href=# rel=noopener>BBC</a>. Phryne in particular was known for her wit. She was able to make a quick play on words, such as when she called a cheap lover “Eros of Pheidias.” Pheidias sounds somewhat similar to another Greek word meaning “thrift,” making this retort the ancient Greek equivalent of a savage burn.</p><p>Phryne was also known for her wealth and generosity. She allegedly accumulated so much money that she offered to fund the rebuilding of the walls of the Greek city Thebes, after they had been destroyed by Alexander the Great some years earlier, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Ancient Origins</a>. In exchange for financing the rebuilding, she wanted the walls to be marked with an acknowledgment that she was their patron. But the city, not wanting to turn to a prostitute for help, ultimately turned her down.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpJ2ybr7IrKiunV2ZsqexzaycZpmeYq6vr8iepa1ll6eypreMnKauqqSawKK6jK6qnpxdqbxurdWooJ1lkWKxpq3ToWSsnZ6psq%2BvxGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
