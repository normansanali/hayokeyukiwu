The actress wrote “Pa lante,” meaning “straight ahead” or “go ahead” indicating encouragement and progress, adding the Mexican flag emoji.</p><p data-characters=565 data-current-count=910 data-injectable=true>The Netflix series made the decision to cast both the children in the Addams family with Latin actors, which makes a lot more sense considering their father is Gomez Addams. Gomez has always been portrayed as the stereotypical Hollywood “Latin Lover,” exuberant, passionate, and adoring of his love. In the Netflix series, Gomez is played by Luis Guzmán, a Puerto Rican actor whilst his children Wednesday and Pugsley are played by Jenna Ortega, whose parents are Mexican and Puerto Rican, and Isaac Ordonez, who is reported to be of Mexican heritage.</p><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=false>The show is doing exceptionally well on Netflix with the show currently sitting in the number one spot in its first week of release. It has also spawned a huge fandom on social media as fans fall in love with Ortega’s portrayal of the iconic character as well as her dance choreography. Maybe one day Cabello and Ortega can team up to create a dance for one of her songs, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">though Lady Gaga may have already beaten her to it</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ykrcyio5plk5avprjLqGShmaNis6K4y56lZqGeYrmwwsRmrqKsmGLEprDNnqqdmalirqWwwKaqZqKlqMFuuMiknGasmJp6s7HSrWSonl2qwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
