Still, fans of either half of the pair of Pitt exes wonder -- did Jennifer and Angelina ever meet? Did Jennifer ever want to confront Angie after all the rumors about her alleged affair with Brad?</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-and-angelina-jolie-both-gave-interviews-about-each-other>Jennifer Aniston And Angelina Jolie Both Gave Interviews About Each Other</h2><p>The interesting thing about Angelina and Jennifer's thoughts on each other is that they both spilled the beans to&nbsp;Vogue on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">separate occasions</a>. Angelina spoke up first, about falling in love with Brad, but the timelines were the primary thing Jennifer took issue with.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Fans Think Jennifer Aniston Wastes Her $300 Million Net Worth On These Items" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Think Jennifer Aniston Wastes Her $300 Million Net Worth On These Items</a></span></p><p>After all, 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' began filming when Jen was still married to Brad. But when Angie spoke up later, she claimed that nothing untoward ever happened with Brad while he was still married. Even though, she admitted, she "didn't know much about exactly where Brad was in his personal life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer, for her part, said that it was 'uncool' of Angelina to speak out in that way. And yet, she's never said anything specifically critical of Angie. She more vaguely referenced Jolie's interview and said it was "a little appropriate."</p><p>But did the two ever meet out of the spotlight to hash out their differences?</p><h2 id=have-angelina-jolie-and-jennifer-aniston-ever-met-in-person>Have Angelina Jolie And Jennifer Aniston Ever Met In Person?</h2><p>Though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">some say she made life difficult for another actor on set</a>, most people agree that Jennifer Aniston is overall a really nice person. At least, publicly. So fans wonder whether Jen would really speak up against Angelina, even if they accidentally crossed paths.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But as it turns out, they once met long before the drama with Brad. In fact, Jennifer approached Angelina, sources say. But in one interview, Jennifer admitted that she saw Angelina once on the 'Friends' lot and stopped to say hi.</p><p>That, she noted, was back in 2006, and she apparently introduced herself to Angie in passing. That was before the movie started filming, of course. And what did Aniston say to Jolie?</p><p>She&nbsp;claimed to have&nbsp;said "Brad is so excited about working with you. I hope you guys have a really good time."</p><p>Those are some interesting meeting&nbsp;and parting words for the pair. After that, sources suggest they never spoke again. And why would they?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apart from their respective and messy connections with Brad, neither had much in common with the other. Well, except for their Hollywood fame and fortune, of course. Then again,&nbsp;some say that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angie is struggling to remain relevant these days</a>, which is why, they reason, she's connected with The Weeknd.</p><p>Only time will tell!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Is Lisa Kudrow Actually Close With Jennifer Aniston And Courteney Cox?" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Lisa Kudrow Actually Close With Jennifer Aniston And Courteney Cox?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdn7KvusifnKtlkaO2tMDOp2SerpWneq6xxK1kmqaXmrmqusBmoaikmZp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
