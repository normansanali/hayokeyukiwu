However, on Friday night, hundreds of Bad Bunny fans were denied entry into Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, a stadium with a capacity of 87,000 people, for a sold-out concert. Fans claimed that the venue told them their tickets were invalid, and photos showed the general-admission field of the stadium half empty a few minutes before Bad Bunny took the stage. While the show went on as planned, many fans were upset that they could not see Benito live and raised more concerns about how Ticketmaster is handling stadium-size events worldwide, especially with one more concert to go tonight. Below are the developing details of the aftermath of Friday‚Äôs Bad Bunny concert in Mexico City.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clbial4ee00293b6ww5zexze4@published>What happened?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbigjcb300493b6wqrt6npyy@published data-word-count=116>Bad Bunny‚Äôs concert in Mexico City on December 9 was not at capacity despite being a sold-out concert. Many fans camped out for days before Friday‚Äôs show to ensure they‚Äôd enter the venue on time. However, numerous fans were denied entry into the stadium for various reasons; the security claimed people had fake tickets, duplicated tickets, or canceled tickets. Some fans even had their tickets <a href=#>confiscated</a> at check-in as security suggested they were using resold or counterfeit tickets, despite them buying their tickets directly from Ticketmaster. Fans told <a href=#>CNN</a> that they saw that their tickets were scanned with a green check mark, meaning it was a valid ticket, yet, they were not allowed inside the venue.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@Ticketmaster</a> has done it again, this is Bad Bunny's first stadium show in Mexico City, which is his BIGGEST market in the entire planet 10 minutes before it‚Äôs supposed to start, as usual this disgusting company is denying the entry to dozens of THOUSANDS of people‚Ä¶ [1/2] <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/z7IU2qasmh</a></p>‚Äî jupiter | fan account (@summerricochet) <a href=#>December 10, 2022</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>UPDATE: The concert's begun and it‚Äôs at 60% of its full capacity, this is BEYOND embarrassing and disrespectful to Bad Bunny and to his fans, SHAME ON YOU <a href=#>@Ticketmaster</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UkBfwcbCIE</a></p>‚Äî jupiter | fan account (@summerricochet) <a href=#>December 10, 2022</a> <span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clbial7sm002i3b6wj9ens0i3@published>How did Ticketmaster respond?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbigeplq003w3b6wcgbfdyrc@published data-word-count=82>Ticketmaster released <a href=#>a statement</a> claiming that there was an unprecedented number of fake tickets, which caused confusion and affected some patrons with valid tickets.
