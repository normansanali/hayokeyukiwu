It seems to be a hard standard to hit, if decades of atrocious video game adaptations are any indication, but fans are still holding out hope for <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Five Nights at Freddy’s</a></strong>.</p><p data-characters=687 data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true>The game hasn’t earned the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best reviews from early viewers</a>, but there’s still hope that it will emerge as a cult classic that translates <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">better among video game fans</a> than newcomers to the story. FNaF is certainly a challenging concept to bring to the big screen, due in large part to its unique antagonists. The story follows a security guard for an abandoned family restaurant as he dodges its increasingly dangerous denizens — sentient animatronic characters with murder in mind. Freddy Fazbear, the restaurant mascot, is easily the most recognizable of the animatronic lineup, but fans of the video games are hoping to see a few more <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">familiar faces crop up in the film</a>.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>That includes a character from Five Nights at Freddy’s 2. Balloon Boy wasn’t an inclusion in the first game, which could restrict him from a cameo in the first adaptation of the series, but fans are still hoping to catch a glimpse of the popular character.</p><h2 id=h-is-balloon-boy-in-five-nights-at-freddy-s data-injectable=false>Is Balloon Boy in Five Nights at Freddy’s?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>It would make sense to restrict the characters in the Five Nights at Freddy’s adaptation to those included in the first game, but its not uncommon for future characters to get a tease in early releases. Balloon Boy technically shouldn’t appear in any story based on the first FNAF game, but that’s not stopping fans from searching every corner for a hint of the character.</p><p data-characters=792 data-current-count=1183 data-injectable=false>And they’re guaranteed to catch a few, so long as they’re paying attention. Balloon Boy doesn’t make a major appearance in Five Nights at Freddy’s — that is, he’s not among the film’s primary animatronics — but he does crop up <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">several times</a> during the film’s runtime. The first time viewers catch a glimpse of him is relatively early in the film, when Mike retrieves his uniform from his locker, and the second comes a fair bit later. Following the credits sequence — yes, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">there’s a post-credits scene in the flick</a> — Balloon Boy makes his second appearance. I won’t spoil the details of his cameos here, but rest assured, fans of the character will get their fill of Balloon Boy teasers in the Five Nights at Freddy’s movie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZooKxlkpa5rbvOp2Sbp6litq9506GcZp6Zq7Juusign62rXZbBbrLRnpudsaNiurDCyJ5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
