Smith) – went up against Team Shannon (named after NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe), which featured Dallas Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons and the Los Angeles Rams receiver Puka Nacua.&nbsp;</p><p id=etMyT7kHXI data-wc=24>Team Shannon won 100 to 91, with Parsons scoring an impressive 37 points and 16 rebounds – making him the MVP of the game.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/216a6c00d313-gettyimages-2016392431.jpg><p id=exsFGjHbtR data-wc=67>Jennifer later took to social media to share her experiences of the game, writing: "I have been dreaming of this moment for such a long time and tonight it finally happened!!!

During his appearance, Jennifer directly asked the musician if he was dating someone, and after an enthusiastic round of cheers from the audience, he stated that that was indeed the case.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>Watch Jennifer ask Common if he is dating anyone</figure><p id=eibKQ5sibPr data-wc=32>"I'm in a relationship with one of the most beautiful people I've ever met in life," he gushed. "She's smart, she loves god, she has something real down-to-earth about her, she's talented."&nbsp;</p><p id=exIRZTlAjG data-wc=56>He then gave away a major hint at the fact that his girlfriend was, in fact, sitting right across him when he teased: "But I set my standard kind of high because she had to have an EGOT, she had to win an Oscar on her first movie, she had to get her own talk show."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
