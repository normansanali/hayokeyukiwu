diet.</p><p>“If you’re thinking about becoming vegan, you can make the shift in small waves if that’s easier for you,” the blog reads.</p><p>“Start by replacing meat with plant-based options once a week and increase from there.”</p><p>Poosh&nbsp;continued: “Kourt admits when she first started, she couldn’t resist and had a baked crab handroll while at dinner during the first few weeks.”</p><p>Her husband, Travis Barker has been vegetarian since his teenage years, and switched over to vegan life after he&nbsp;survived a plane crash in 2008.</p><p>Aside from trying to eat

and high-protein meals.</p><h2>EATING FOR TWO?</h2><p>Fans took notice that the video doesn’t really show Kourtney eating much of her food.</p><p>It comes as some fans speculate that she could be
