By Douglas Helm | Updated 10 months ago Plenty of celebs showed out in style at the 2023 Met Gala — Jared Leto literally wore a cat costume — but perhaps none impressed more than Florence Pugh and her bold shaved head look. The Dune: Part Two star looked positively royal at the event, which was themed to pay tribute to the late fashion icon Karl Lagerfeld."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The <a href=#>Dune: Part Two</a> star looked positively royal at the event, which was themed to pay tribute to the late fashion icon Karl Lagerfeld. Appropriately, Pugh’s dynamic gown and headpiece were a monochromatic black and white, a style Lagerfeld was famous for:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Florence Pugh shaving her head just for the Met Gala would have been next-level dedication, but it turns out she actually shaved it for a role. Pugh revealed that the look was for an upcoming movie called We Live in Time. However, she was able to keep the look under wraps long enough to debut it at the Met Gala.</p><p>Florence Pugh’s character having a shaved head is one of the few details we have about her upcoming <a href=#>We Live in Time</a> film. It currently doesn’t have a release date, and the plot is being kept under wraps. What we do know is that John Crowley is directing a script by Nick Payne and <a href=#>Andrew Garfield</a> is co-starring alongside Pugh, Adam James, and Marama Corlett.</p><p>Of course, Florence Pugh also has three massive blockbusters on her schedule that we know a lot more about. The first one is the upcoming Christopher Nolan film <a href=#>Oppenheimer</a> which will star Cillian Murphy as the titular A-bomb scientist. Along with Murphy and Pugh, the film also stars Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Jack Quaid, Kenneth Branagh, Gary Oldman, Josh Hartnett, Alden Ehrenreich, Gustaf Skarsgard, David Dastmalchian, Olivia Thirlby, Rami Malek, Tony Goldwyn, Dane DeHaan, Alex Wolff, and Casey Affleck.</p><p>We’ll get to see Florence Pugh in Oppenheimer this year, as the film is slated for a July 21 release. We’ll also get to see her in one more film before the year is over when she makes her debut as Princess Irulan in the highly anticipated Dune: Part Two on November 3. The Denis Villeneuve-directed film will adapt the second half of Frank Herbert’s seminal sci-fi novel.</p><p>Along with Florence Pugh, new cast members for the sequel include Christopher Walken as Emperor Shaddam IV, Lea Seydoux as Lady Margot, and Austin Butler as Feyd Rautha-Harkonnen. Returning cast members include Timothee Chalamet as Paul Atreides, Zendaya as Chani, Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica, Javier Bardem as Stilgar, Stellan Skarsgard as Baron Harkonnen, Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck, and Dave Bautista as Beast Rabban.</p><p>Finally, we’ll have to wait until July 26, 2024, to see Florence Pugh return to the MCU as the fan-favorite Yelena Belova. She’ll be starring in Thunderbolts, which is the MCU’s supervillain team that goes on missions for the government. Joining her will be Sebastian Stan&nbsp;as Winter Soldier,&nbsp;David Harbour&nbsp;as Red Guardian,&nbsp;Julia Louis-Dreyfus&nbsp;as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine,&nbsp;Wyatt Russell&nbsp;as US Agent, Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost, Olga Kurylenko as Taskmaster, and <a href=#>Steven Yeun</a> and The Bear‘s Ayo Edebiri&nbsp;in undisclosed roles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/black-widow-florence-pugh-social-900x506.jpg><p>In other words, Florence Pugh has a lot going on in the near future. For now, you can revisit some of her most recent roles on streaming. Don’t Worry Darling is currently available to stream on HBO Max and you can watch Puss in Boots: The Last Wish on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnlqG8s7HNnJxmqKWctW60wKKpZqyilru0ss6rpJqsmaS7b7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
