When signing on to a show like The Walking Dead, most actors know there’s a risk that they’ll be killed off — but Chandler Riggs’ dad did not see the twist coming. The actor’s character, Carl Grimes, was bitten by a zombie during the finale. He did not die in the episode and fans will get a chance to say their goodbyes in February when the show returns."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The post has since been deleted. “I never trusted Gimple or AMC but Chandler did. I know how much it hurt him. But we do absolutely know how lucky we have been to be a part of it all and appreciate all the love from fans all these years!”</p><p>This isn’t the first time Riggs’ father posted about the show. In November 2016, he shared a photo with his son in Instagram, <a href=#>celebrating the end of his seven-year contract</a>. He added the caption “#freedom.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/the-walking-dead-carl-rick.jpg><p>The actor admitted following the episode that <a href=#>leaving the show was not his decision</a> but was “story related” and important to the future for the show.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I was planning on going to college until I found out. I found out when I was doing rehearsals for episode six back in June. It was quite the shocker for me, Andy and everyone because I don’t think anyone saw it coming,” he told <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “It’s definitely not a bad thing because it has been awesome being on the show but now I get to go and do a lot of other stuff that I haven’t gotten to do before. Scott wanted to meet in person because it was such a big deal. We had just finished rehearsing for a scene in episode six and he wanted to meet with me and my mom and dad and talk about what’s going to happen.”</p><p class=p1>The Walking Dead returns to AMC Sunday, February 25, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2srq23yKeeZpyVlrFuv9OaqaxllJaxbr%2FLmqSsZZGisG6yzqtkpKGcobavs4yonZ9lo6S7cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
