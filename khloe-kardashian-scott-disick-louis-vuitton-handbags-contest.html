You can enter to win their most recent Instagram giveaway. There are just a few stipulations — well, a few more than a few.</p><p>On Monday, June 17, both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keeping Up With the Kardashian</a> stars posted a snap on Instagram of Khloe sitting in a car, surrounded by seven Louis Vuitton <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bags</a> worth over $12,000. In the caption, they both explain that they’re giving them all away to one lucky winner, along with $20,000 in cash. So how can you get in on all these goodies? Well, settle in — there’s a lot to know.</p><p>The main goal is to follow everyone that Disick follows. Seems crazy, right? While he may have millions of followers, luckily he only follows 72 people. So as both reality stars claim in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> it should take about 90 seconds to do. That is if you’re able to follow everyone all at once. Disick points out in his post that you may only be able to follow a limited number of the folks— that’s because social platform caps your follow number at 7,500 at once and only allows you to follow or unfollow 20 users an hour. So if you’re close to the limit, you’ll have to delete a few to fit all 72.</p><p>Once that’s done, you have to go back to one of their posts and write whom you’d share the prize with or whether you plan to keep it all for yourself.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Then there are few other small things that are required of all contestants, such as if you have a private page you’ll have to make it public to be eligible and you have to be 18 or older to enter. Once it’s over, there is still one more rule. The winner has to post an “’I WON’ image on their page.”</p><p>It seems like a lot of steps but if you do happen to win you’ll have any type of Louis Vuitton bag you could ever possibly need. Ranging from a suitcase to a tote to a small night-out clutch, there’s a monogrammed bag for every occasion.</p><p>If you are interested, gather your patience and head over to enter before 7 P.M. PST on Wednesday, June 19. Good luck!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6C1rbvEZqKaqpSWwKm1wKdkrJufqcFusMisoJyjXaG8trXSZq2uoaSpvK95x5qlnZqRnMBur86nq56rpGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
