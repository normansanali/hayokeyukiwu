On top of this, various sponsorships and non-football business ventures have helped swell his total assets. Kane's ability to diversify his income streams and investments, such as real estate and tech startups, has also augmented his net worth.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Comparison to Peers</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>When stacked against other vital names, Harry Kane emerged as one of the wealthiest footballers by 2024.
